The table must have distinct divisors in each cell.\n</assumption>\n\n<decompose>\nFirst, let's break down the problem. We need to consider the set of all positive divisors of n. Let's denote this set as D(n). The task is to arrange all elements of D(n) into a rectangular table (say, r rows and c columns) such that:\n\n1. Each divisor is used exactly once.\n2. The sum of each row is the same.\n3. The sum of each column is the same.\n</decompose>\n\n<constraint>\nSince the table is rectangular, the total number of divisors, say k, must equal r*c. So, k = r*c. Also, the sum of all divisors, \u03c3(n), must be equal to r times the row sum or c times the column sum. So, \u03c3(n) = r * row_sum = c * col_sum. Therefore, r and c must be divisors of \u03c3(n).\n</constraint>\n\n<equivalent>\nThis implies that the number of divisors of n, k, must be expressible as a product of two positive integers r and c, where both r and c divide \u03c3(n). Additionally, the average row sum is \u03c3(n)/r and the average column sum is \u03c3(n)/c. Since all row sums and column sums must be integers, \u03c3(n) must be divisible by both r and c.\n</equivalent>\n\n<case_analysis>\nLet's consider small values of n and check possible configurations.\n\nStart with n=1. The only divisor is 1. So, the table is 1x1. Trivially satisfies the conditions. So n=1 is a solution.\n\nNext, n=2. Divisors are 1,2. Possible rectangular tables: 1x2 or 2x1. For 1x2: row sum is 1+2=3. Column sums would be 1 and 2, which are unequal. For 2x1: column sum is 3, row sums are 1 and 2, which are unequal. So n=2 is not possible.\n\nn=3: divisors 1,3. Similarly, 1x2 doesn't work. 2x1 doesn't work. So n=3 is out.\n\nn=4: divisors 1,2,4. Number of divisors k=3. We need r*c=3. So possible (1,3) or (3,1). For 1x3: row sum is 7, column sums are 1,2,4. Not equal. For 3x1: column sum 7, row sums 1,2,4. Not equal. So n=4 is out.\n\nn=5: divisors 1,5. Similar to above, cannot form a rectangle. So no.\n\nn=6: divisors 1,2,3,6. k=4. Possible r*c=4. So (1,4), (2,2), (4,1). Let's check (2,2): rows and columns each 2x2. The total sum \u03c3(6)=1+2+3+6=12. So each row sum must be 12/2=6, and each column sum must be 12/2=6. Can we arrange 1,2,3,6 in a 2x2 table where each row and column sums to 6?\n\nLet's try:\n\nFirst row: 6 and 0? No, 0 not in divisors. Wait, divisors are 1,2,3,6. Let's see:\n\nPossible pairs that sum to 6:\n\n1 + 5 (but 5 isn't a divisor), 2 +4 (4 isn't a divisor), 3 +3 (but duplicates not allowed). Wait, the rows need to sum to 6. So possible pairs:\n\n1 + 5 invalid, 2 +4 invalid, 3 +3 invalid. Wait, but we have 6, which is 6. So maybe a row could be 6 and 0, but 0 isn't a divisor. Alternatively, perhaps 3 + 3, but duplicates. Wait, but all divisors must be distinct. So in a 2x2 table, each row must have two distinct divisors summing to 6. Let's see:\n\nPossible pairs:\n\n1 + 2 = 3 \u22606\n\n1 + 3 = 4 \u22606\n\n1 +6 =7 \u22606\n\n2 +3=5 \u22606\n\n3 +6=9 \u22606\n\n6 alone can't form a row with another. Wait, but we need two numbers per row. So none of the pairs sum to 6. Therefore, it's impossible. So 2x2 doesn't work.\n\nNext, check 1x4 or 4x1, but those would require row or column sums to be 3, which is impossible as earlier. So n=6 is out.\n\nn=8: divisors 1,2,4,8. k=4. Same as n=6. So same problem. Can't form 2x2 table with row and column sums 3 each. So n=8 is out.\n\nn=7: divisors 1,7. Can't form a rectangle. So no.\n\nn=9: divisors 1,3,9. k=3. Similarly, can't form a rectangle. So no.\n\nn=16: divisors 1,2,4,8,16. k=5. 5 is prime, so only 1x5 or 5x1. 1x5 sum is 31, row sum 31, column sums 1,2,4,8,16. Not equal. So no.\n\nn=10: divisors 1,2,5,10. k=4. So possible 2x2 table. Sum is 1+2+5+10=18. Each row and column must sum to 9. Can we arrange them?\n\nPossible pairs summing to 9:\n\n1 +8=9, but 8 not a divisor. 2 +7=9, 7 not a divisor. 5 +4=9, 4 not a divisor. 10 - but 10 is in the divisors. Wait, 10 is 10. So 10 and -1, but negative numbers aren't divisors. So no pairs sum to 9. So 2x2 doesn't work. Hence, n=10 is out.\n\nWait, but maybe a different arrangement. Wait, divisors are 1,2,5,10. Let's try:\n\nFirst row: 10 and -1 (no). Not possible. So no. Hence, n=10 is out.\n\nn=15: divisors 1,3,5,15. k=4. Similar to n=6. Sum is 24. Each row and column sum must be 12. Again, pairs:\n\n1 +11=12 (11 not a divisor). 3 +9=12 (9 not a divisor). 5 +7=12 (7 not a divisor). 15 -3=12. So 15 and -3. Not possible. So no.\n\nn=16: already checked.\n\nn=1024? Wait, maybe we need a different approach.\n\nWait, let's consider n=1. It works. Maybe other n's?\n\nWait, let's try n=3: divisors 1,3. k=2. To form a rectangle, need 1x2 or 2x1. But in both cases, the sums of rows or columns would be 4, but the other dimension's sum is 1 or 3. So not equal. So n=3 is out.\n\nn=1 works. Let's check n=1: only divisor is 1. So 1x1 table. Yes.\n\nn=6: divisors 1,2,3,6. k=4. If we can arrange them in 2x2 table with row and column sums 6 each. Let's try:\n\nFirst row: 6 and 0? No. Wait, possible pairs:\n\n1 + 5 (no). 2 +4 (no). 3 +3 (duplicate). So no. So no.\n\nWait, but wait, divisors are 1,2,3,6. Let's see:\n\nSuppose first row: 1 and 6. Sum is 7. Not 6. Second row: 2 and 3. Sum is 5. Not 6. So no. So impossible.\n\nWait, but \u03c3(6)=12. 12 divided by 2 rows is 6 per row. So each row must sum to 6. Similarly, columns must sum to 6. But as per above, no pairs sum to 6. So no.\n\nSo n=6 is out.\n\nWait, what about n=1. Maybe the only solution is n=1. Let's check n=28. Divisors: 1,2,4,7,14,28. k=6. So possible r*c=6. So options: 1x6, 2x3, 3x2, 6x1.\n\nSum of divisors \u03c3(28)=1+2+4+7+14+28=56. So for 2x3 table, each row sum would be 56/2=28, each column sum 56/3\u224818.666, which is not integer. So 2x3 is invalid. Similarly, 3x2 would need columns sum 28, rows sum \u224818.666. Not integer. So 2x3 or 3x2 is out.\n\nWhat about 1x6: row sum 56, columns would each have one element, so sums are 1,2,4,7,14,28. Not equal. Similarly 6x1. So n=28 is out.\n\nWait, maybe n=1 is the only solution. Let's check n=16 again. Divisors 1,2,4,8,16. k=5. Can't form rectangle.\n\nWait, n=1 is the only one so far. Let's check n=36. Divisors: 1,2,3,4,6,9,12,18,36. k=9. So possible 3x3 or 9x1. For 3x3: sum is 72. So each row and column must sum to 24. Let's see if we can arrange them.\n\nBut this is getting time-consuming. Maybe there's a pattern here. The only n that works is n=1. Let's see why.\n\nIn n=1, there's only one divisor, so 1x1 table. That's trivial. For other n, the number of divisors k must be a product of two integers r and c such that \u03c3(n) is divisible by both r and c. But even if \u03c3(n) is divisible by r and c, arranging the divisors into a rectangular grid with equal row and column sums is non-trivial.\n\nFor example, for n=6, k=4. If we could arrange into 2x2 with row and column sums 6 each, but as we saw, it's impossible. Similarly for other numbers. So maybe the only solution is n=1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe n=3. Wait, n=3 has divisors 1,3. If we try 1x2: row sum 4, column sums 1 and 3. Not equal. 2x1: column sum 4, row sums 1 and 3. Not equal. So no.\n\nWait, perhaps n=3^3=27. Divisors: 1,3,9,27. k=4. Similar to previous cases. 2x2: sum 40. Each row and column must sum to 20. Possible pairs: 1 +19 (no), 3 +17 (no), 9 +11 (no). So no.\n\nWait, n=1 is the only number where the number of divisors is 1, so can form a 1x1 table. For other numbers, the number of divisors is at least 2. Let's check n=28, which has divisors 1,2,4,7,14,28. k=6. 2x3 grid. Sum is 56. Each row sum 28, each column sum \u224818.666. Not integer. So no.\n\nn=16: divisors 1,2,4,8,16. k=5. 1x5: row sum 31, column sums 1,2,4,8,16. No.\n\nn=10: divisors 1,2,5,10. k=4. 2x2. Sum 18. Each row and column sum 9. Pairs needed: 1 +8=9 (no), 2 +7=9 (no), 5 +4=9 (no). So no.\n\nn=4: divisors 1,2,4. k=3. 1x3 or 3x1. Sum 7. Can't split into equal rows or columns.\n\nWait, maybe n=1 is the only solution. Let's check n=336. Divisors are many, but probably can't form such a table. Alternatively, perhaps only n=1 works.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the case when the table is 1x1. That's n=1. For other n, the number of divisors must be composite so that we can have r and c both greater than 1. But even so, arranging the divisors into a rectangle with equal row and column sums seems difficult.\n\nWait, but perhaps n=1 is the only solution. Let's check n=3: divisors 1,3. Can't form 2x2. n=5: same. So maybe only n=1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe n=336 is a candidate. But I need to think of a different approach.\n\nLet me consider the problem algebraically. Let S = \u03c3(n) be the sum of divisors. Let r and c be the number of rows and columns. Then, S must be divisible by both r and c. So r and c are divisors of S. Also, since the table has r rows and c columns, and each row has c divisors, each column has r divisors. Therefore, the total number of divisors k = r*c. So \u03c3(n) must be divisible by both r and c, and k = r*c.\n\nTherefore, for n to satisfy the condition, \u03c3(n) must have a factorization into r and c such that r*c is the number of divisors of n, and that the divisors can be arranged into a matrix with equal row and column sums.\n\nThis seems very restrictive. The only case where this is possible is when n=1, since for n=1, \u03c3(1)=1, and k=1=1*1. So the table is 1x1, which trivially satisfies the conditions.\n\nFor other n, \u03c3(n) must have multiple factors. For example, if \u03c3(n) is even, it's possible to have r and c both even or one even and one odd. But even then, arranging the divisors into such a table with equal sums is non-trivial.\n\nBut maybe n is a perfect number. For example, n=6. \u03c3(6)=12. The number of divisors is 4. So 4=2x2. But as we saw earlier, can't arrange the divisors into a 2x2 table with equal row and column sums. Similarly, n=28, \u03c3=56. 56=7x8. So 7 rows and 8 columns. But k=9, so 7x8=56? No, 7x8=56, but k=9. So that's impossible. So \u03c3(n) must equal r*c. So for n=6, \u03c3(n)=12, and k=4. 12=2x6, but 2x6 would need 6 rows and 2 columns, but k=4. So not possible. Wait, confusion here.\n\nWait, \u03c3(n) is the sum of divisors. The number of divisors is k. So r*c=k. Therefore, \u03c3(n) must be divisible by r and c, and r*c must equal k. So for example, if n=6, \u03c3(n)=12, k=4. So we need r*c=4. So possible (1,4), (2,2), (4,1). For (2,2), \u03c3(n)=12. Each row sum must be 6, each column sum must be 6. But as we saw, can't form such pairs.\n\nSimilarly, for n=28, \u03c3=56, k=9. So r*c=9. Possible (1,9), (3,3), (9,1). For (3,3), sum per row would be 56/3 \u224818.666, which is not integer. So no.\n\nTherefore, the only possible case where \u03c3(n) is divisible by r and c, and r*c=k, is when n=1. Because for n=1, \u03c3(n)=1, k=1, so r=1, c=1. This works.\n\nTherefore, the answer is n=1.\n\nBut wait, let's check n=3. Divisors 1,3. k=2. So possible (1,2). \u03c3(n)=4. So row sum 4, column sum 4. But arranging 1 and 3 into 1x2 or 2x1. In 1x2: [4,0] which is invalid. In 2x1: [4,0] also invalid. So no.\n\nSimilarly, n=3 is out.\n\nn=1 is the only number where \u03c3(n)=k, so possible. Therefore, the answer is n=1.\n</think>\nThe problem requires finding all positive integers \\( n \\) such that all positive divisors of \\( n \\) can be arranged in a rectangular table with equal row and column sums. \n\n1. **Key Constraints**:\n   - The number of divisors \\( k \\) of \\( n \\) must equal \\( r \\times c \\), where \\( r \\) is the number of rows and \\( c \\) is the number of columns.\n   - The sum of all divisors \\( \\sigma(n) \\) must be divisible by both \\( r \\) and \\( c \\).\n\n2. **Analysis**:\n   - For \\( n = 1 \\), the only divisor is 1, which can be arranged in a \\( 1 \\times 1 \\) table.

                "reasoning": "<assumption>\nThe problem is to find all positive integers n such that all positive divisors of n can be arranged in a rectangular table where each row's sum is equal and each column's sum is equal. The table must have distinct divisors in each cell.\n</assumption>\n\n<decompose>\nFirst, let's break down the problem. We need to consider the set of all positive divisors of n. Let's denote this set as D(n). The task is to arrange all elements of D(n) into a rectangular table (say, r rows and c columns) such that:\n\n1. Each divisor is used exactly once.\n2.

Therefore, r and c must be divisors of \u03c3(n).\n</constraint>\n\n<equivalent>\nThis implies that the number of divisors of n, k, must be expressible as a product of two positive integers r and c, where both r and c divide \u03c3(n). Additionally, the average row sum is \u03c3(n)/r and the average column sum is \u03c3(n)/c. Since all row sums and column sums must be integers, \u03c3(n) must be divisible by both r and c.\n</equivalent>\n\n<case_analysis>\nLet's consider small values of n and check possible configurations.\n\nStart with n=1. The only divisor is 1. So, the table is 1x1. Trivially satisfies the conditions. So n=1 is a solution.\n\nNext, n=2. Divisors are 1,2. Possible rectangular tables: 1x2 or 2x1. For 1x2: row sum is 1+2=3. Column sums would be 1 and 2, which are unequal. For 2x1: column sum is 3, row sums are 1 and 2, which are unequal. So n=2 is not possible.\n\nn=3: divisors 1,3. Similarly, 1x2 doesn't work. 2x1 doesn't work. So n=3 is out.\n\nn=4: divisors 1,2,4. Number of divisors k=3. We need r*c=3. So possible (1,3) or (3,1). For 1x3: row sum is 7, column sums are 1,2,4. Not equal. For 3x1: column sum 7, row sums 1,2,4. Not equal. So n=4 is out.\n\nn=5: divisors 1,5. Similar to above, cannot form a rectangle. So no.\n\nn=6: divisors 1,2,3,6. k=4. Possible r*c=4. So (1,4), (2,2), (4,1). Let's check (2,2): rows and columns each 2x2. The total sum \u03c3(6)=1+2+3+6=12. So each row sum must be 12/2=6, and each column sum must be 12/2=6. Can we arrange 1,2,3,6 in a 2x2 table where each row and column sums to 6?\n\nLet's try:\n\nFirst row: 6 and 0? No, 0 not in divisors. Wait, divisors are 1,2,3,6. Let's see:\n\nPossible pairs that sum to 6:\n\n1 + 5 (but 5 isn't a divisor), 2 +4 (4 isn't a divisor), 3 +3 (but duplicates not allowed). Wait, the rows need to sum to 6. So possible pairs:\n\n1 + 5 invalid, 2 +4 invalid, 3 +3 invalid. Wait, but we have 6, which is 6. So maybe a row could be 6 and 0, but 0 isn't a divisor. Alternatively, perhaps 3 + 3, but duplicates. Wait, but all divisors must be distinct. So in a 2x2 table, each row must have two distinct divisors summing to 6. Let's see:\n\nPossible pairs:\n\n1 + 2 = 3 \u22606\n\n1 + 3 = 4 \u22606\n\n1 +6 =7 \u22606\n\n2 +3=5 \u22606\n\n3 +6=9 \u22606\n\n6 alone can't form a row with another. Wait, but we need two numbers per row. So none of the pairs sum to 6. Therefore, it's impossible. So 2x2 doesn't work.\n\nNext, check 1x4 or 4x1, but those would require row or column sums to be 3, which is impossible as earlier. So n=6 is out.\n\nn=8: divisors 1,2,4,8. k=4. Same as n=6. So same problem. Can't form 2x2 table with row and column sums 3 each. So n=8 is out.\n\nn=7: divisors 1,7. Can't form a rectangle. So no.\n\nn=9: divisors 1,3,9. k=3. Similarly, can't form a rectangle. So no.\n\nn=16: divisors 1,2,4,8,16. k=5. 5 is prime, so only 1x5 or 5x1. 1x5 sum is 31, row sum 31, column sums 1,2,4,8,16. Not equal. So no.\n\nn=10: divisors 1,2,5,10. k=4. So possible 2x2 table. Sum is 1+2+5+10=18. Each row and column must sum to 9. Can we arrange them?\n\nPossible pairs summing to 9:\n\n1 +8=9, but 8 not a divisor. 2 +7=9, 7 not a divisor. 5 +4=9, 4 not a divisor. 10 - but 10 is in the divisors. Wait, 10 is 10. So 10 and -1, but negative numbers aren't divisors. So no pairs sum to 9. So 2x2 doesn't work. Hence, n=10 is out.\n\nWait, but maybe a different arrangement. Wait, divisors are 1,2,5,10. Let's try:\n\nFirst row: 10 and -1 (no). Not possible. So no. Hence, n=10 is out.\n\nn=15: divisors 1,3,5,15. k=4. Similar to n=6. Sum is 24. Each row and column sum must be 12. Again, pairs:\n\n1 +11=12 (11 not a divisor). 3 +9=12 (9 not a divisor). 5 +7=12 (7 not a divisor). 15 -3=12. So 15 and -3. Not possible. So no.\n\nn=16: already checked.\n\nn=1024? Wait, maybe we need a different approach.\n\nWait, let's consider n=1. It works. Maybe other n's?\n\nWait, let's try n=3: divisors 1,3. k=2. To form a rectangle, need 1x2 or 2x1. But in both cases, the sums of rows or columns would be 4, but the other dimension's sum is 1 or 3. So not equal. So n=3 is out.\n\nn=1 works. Let's check n=1: only divisor is 1. So 1x1 table. Yes.\n\nn=6: divisors 1,2,3,6. k=4. If we can arrange them in 2x2 table with row and column sums 6 each. Let's try:\n\nFirst row: 6 and 0? No. Wait, possible pairs:\n\n1 + 5 (no). 2 +4 (no). 3 +3 (duplicate). So no. So no.\n\nWait, but wait, divisors are 1,2,3,6. Let's see:\n\nSuppose first row: 1 and 6. Sum is 7. Not 6. Second row: 2 and 3. Sum is 5. Not 6. So no. So impossible.\n\nWait, but \u03c3(6)=12. 12 divided by 2 rows is 6 per row. So each row must sum to 6. Similarly, columns must sum to 6. But as per above, no pairs sum to 6. So no.\n\nSo n=6 is out.\n\nWait, what about n=1. Maybe the only solution is n=1. Let's check n=28. Divisors: 1,2,4,7,14,28. k=6. So possible r*c=6. So options: 1x6, 2x3, 3x2, 6x1.\n\nSum of divisors \u03c3(28)=1+2+4+7+14+28=56. So for 2x3 table, each row sum would be 56/2=28, each column sum 56/3\u224818.666, which is not integer. So 2x3 is invalid. Similarly, 3x2 would need columns sum 28, rows sum \u224818.666. Not integer. So 2x3 or 3x2 is out.\n\nWhat about 1x6: row sum 56, columns would each have one element, so sums are 1,2,4,7,14,28. Not equal. Similarly 6x1. So n=28 is out.\n\nWait, maybe n=1 is the only solution. Let's check n=16 again. Divisors 1,2,4,8,16. k=5. Can't form rectangle.\n\nWait, n=1 is the only one so far. Let's check n=36. Divisors: 1,2,3,4,6,9,12,18,36. k=9. So possible 3x3 or 9x1. For 3x3: sum is 72. So each row and column must sum to 24. Let's see if we can arrange them.\n\nBut this is getting time-consuming. Maybe there's a pattern here. The only n that works is n=1. Let's see why.\n\nIn n=1, there's only one divisor, so 1x1 table. That's trivial. For other n, the number of divisors k must be a product of two integers r and c such that \u03c3(n) is divisible by both r and c. But even if \u03c3(n) is divisible by r and c, arranging the divisors into a rectangular grid with equal row and column sums is non-trivial.\n\nFor example, for n=6, k=4. If we could arrange into 2x2 with row and column sums 6 each, but as we saw, it's impossible. Similarly for other numbers. So maybe the only solution is n=1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe n=3. Wait, n=3 has divisors 1,3. If we try 1x2: row sum 4, column sums 1 and 3. Not equal. 2x1: column sum 4, row sums 1 and 3. Not equal. So no.\n\nWait, perhaps n=3^3=27. Divisors: 1,3,9,27. k=4. Similar to previous cases. 2x2: sum 40. Each row and column must sum to 20. Possible pairs: 1 +19 (no), 3 +17 (no), 9 +11 (no). So no.\n\nWait, n=1 is the only number where the number of divisors is 1, so can form a 1x1 table. For other numbers, the number of divisors is at least 2. Let's check n=28, which has divisors 1,2,4,7,14,28. k=6. 2x3 grid. Sum is 56. Each row sum 28, each column sum \u224818.666. Not integer. So no.\n\nn=16: divisors 1,2,4,8,16. k=5. 1x5: row sum 31, column sums 1,2,4,8,16. No.\n\nn=10: divisors 1,2,5,10. k=4. 2x2. Sum 18. Each row and column sum 9. Pairs needed: 1 +8=9 (no), 2 +7=9 (no), 5 +4=9 (no). So no.\n\nn=4: divisors 1,2,4. k=3. 1x3 or 3x1. Sum 7. Can't split into equal rows or columns.\n\nWait, maybe n=1 is the only solution. Let's check n=336. Divisors are many, but probably can't form such a table. Alternatively, perhaps only n=1 works.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the case when the table is 1x1. That's n=1. For other n, the number of divisors must be composite so that we can have r and c both greater than 1. But even so, arranging the divisors into a rectangle with equal row and column sums seems difficult.\n\nWait, but perhaps n=1 is the only solution. Let's check n=3: divisors 1,3. Can't form 2x2. n=5: same. So maybe only n=1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe n=336 is a candidate. But I need to think of a different approach.\n\nLet me consider the problem algebraically. Let S = \u03c3(n) be the sum of divisors. Let r and c be the number of rows and columns. Then, S must be divisible by both r and c. So r and c are divisors of S. Also, since the table has r rows and c columns, and each row has c divisors, each column has r divisors. Therefore, the total number of divisors k = r*c. So \u03c3(n) must be divisible by both r and c, and k = r*c.\n\nTherefore, for n to satisfy the condition, \u03c3(n) must have a factorization into r and c such that r*c is the number of divisors of n, and that the divisors can be arranged into a matrix with equal row and column sums.\n\nThis seems very restrictive. The only case where this is possible is when n=1, since for n=1, \u03c3(1)=1, and k=1=1*1. So the table is 1x1, which trivially satisfies the conditions.\n\nFor other n, \u03c3(n) must have multiple factors. For example, if \u03c3(n) is even, it's possible to have r and c both even or one even and one odd. But even then, arranging the divisors into such a table with equal sums is non-trivial.\n\nBut maybe n is a perfect number. For example, n=6. \u03c3(6)=12. The number of divisors is 4. So 4=2x2. But as we saw earlier, can't arrange the divisors into a 2x2 table with equal row and column sums. Similarly, n=28, \u03c3=56. 56=7x8. So 7 rows and 8 columns. But k=9, so 7x8=56? No, 7x8=56, but k=9. So that's impossible. So \u03c3(n) must equal r*c. So for n=6, \u03c3(n)=12, and k=4. 12=2x6, but 2x6 would need 6 rows and 2 columns, but k=4. So not possible. Wait, confusion here.\n\nWait, \u03c3(n) is the sum of divisors. The number of divisors is k. So r*c=k. Therefore, \u03c3(n) must be divisible by r and c, and r*c must equal k. So for example, if n=6, \u03c3(n)=12, k=4. So we need r*c=4. So possible (1,4), (2,2), (4,1). For (2,2), \u03c3(n)=12. Each row sum must be 6, each column sum must be 6. But as we saw, can't form such pairs.\n\nSimilarly, for n=28, \u03c3=56, k=9. So r*c=9. Possible (1,9), (3,3), (9,1). For (3,3), sum per row would be 56/3 \u224818.666, which is not integer. So no.\n\nTherefore, the only possible case where \u03c3(n) is divisible by r and c, and r*c=k, is when n=1. Because for n=1, \u03c3(n)=1, k=1, so r=1, c=1. This works.\n\nTherefore, the answer is n=1.\n\nBut wait, let's check n=3. Divisors 1,3. k=2. So possible (1,2). \u03c3(n)=4. So row sum 4, column sum 4. But arranging 1 and 3 into 1x2 or 2x1. In 1x2: [4,0] which is invalid. In 2x1: [4,0] also invalid. So no.\n\nSimilarly, n=3 is out.\n\nn=1 is the only number where \u03c3(n)=k, so possible. Therefore, the answer is n=1.",

                "full_response": "<assumption> The problem is about determining the number of ways to define a rule that satisfies three specific conditions related to card sets A and B. Let me break down each condition and see how they interact.\n\nFirst, the setup: an infinite deck of cards with each real number exactly once. Two players each draw 100 cards, forming sets A and B. The rule to decide the winner must depend only on the relative order of the 200 cards, not their actual values. Also, if in the ordered list, every element of A is greater than the corresponding element in B when both are sorted, then A should win. Additionally, the rule must be transitive: if A beats B and B beats C, then A must beat C.\n\n<equivalent> Condition 2 reminds me of a concept in order theory called a \" comparing sequences.\" The idea that A beats B when A's elements are all greater than B's when both are sorted. This is similar to a dominant sequence. Condition 3 suggests transitivity, which is a key property of a total order, but since we're dealing with subsets, it's more about a tournament graph being transitive.\n\n<analogy> This seems similar to voting systems or comparing ranked candidates where the outcome is transitive. In transitive tournaments, the outcomes form a total order. However, here we are dealing with subsets, not individual candidates. Maybe each card can be assigned a value, and the rule is based on some total order that extends the ranking.\n\n<constraint> The rule must be based only on the relative order, so the actual numbers on the cards don't matter, just their sequence. That means the rule must be a function of the permutation of the union of A and B. Also, transitivity is crucial. So, the rule must define a transitive relation over all possible A and B.\n\n<generalize> If the rule is based on some total order of all real numbers, then for any two sets A and B, we can compare them by looking at their ordered elements. However, the problem states that the rule depends only on the relative order of the 200 cards. So, the total order of all reals is unnecessary; instead, the rule uses the relative positions of the 200 cards. But wait, the total order of all reals would allow comparing any two cards, but here the rule is based on the relative order within A and B. Hmm, maybe the rule is equivalent to a linear extension of the partial order defined by the relative positions.\n\n<contradiction> If the rule is based only on the relative order, then two different orderings of the same set of 200 cards could lead to different winners. But the rule must be consistent. For example, if in one ordering A beats B, and in another ordering, B beats A, then the rule is invalid. Therefore, the rule must assign a winner in such a way that the relation is transitive.\n\n<case_analysis> Let's consider small cases first. Suppose instead of 100 cards each, we had 1 card each. Then, the rule would be that the single card in A beats the single card in B if it's the larger one. But transitivity would require that if A beats B and B beats C, then A beats C. This is possible if the rule is based on the actual values, but since the rule must depend only on the relative order, how can we define it? If we order the three cards and compare them pairwise, but the problem is that the rule has to be consistent across all possible pair comparisons.\n\n<equivalent> Wait, if the rule must be transitive, then the relation must be a total order. But since the rule is based only on the relative order of the 200 cards, the only way the relation is transitive is if the rule is equivalent to a linear extension of the partial order defined by the relative positions. However, the set of all possible 200-card combinations is too large to be a total order. But the problem states that the rule is defined for any A and B, so the rule must be a function that, given any two sets A and B, outputs a winner based on their relative order, and this function must be transitive.\n\n<assumption> Maybe the rule is equivalent to a social choice function that is transitive. In social choice theory, a transitive social welfare function is a dictatorship. But here, with 100 subsets each time, perhaps the rule is dictatorial. That is, one player's set is chosen based on some fixed ordering.\n\n<inference> If the rule is dictatorial, then there exists a specific card whose value determines the winner. For example, suppose the rule is that the player whose highest card is the maximum in all 200 cards wins. But wait, if we don't know the actual values, but only the relative order, then the maximum in the combined 200 cards is the highest card. So if one set has the highest card, they win. But condition 2 says that if in the ordered A and B, every a_i > b_i, then A wins. However, the maximum card in the combined set could be in A or B. If the maximum is in A, then a_1 is the maximum, so a_1 > all other cards including b_1. Therefore, since a_i > b_i for all i, including i=1, so a_1 > b_1, which satisfies condition 2. So if the rule is that the set with the maximum card wins, then condition 2 is satisfied. Also, transitivity would hold because if A has a higher maximum than B, and B has a higher maximum than C, then A has a higher maximum than C, so the rule is transitive.\n\n<verify> So a dictatorial rule where the winner is the set containing the maximum card in the union would satisfy all three conditions. But are there other possible rules? Suppose there are two possible winners sometimes. For example, if the rule is based on who has the higher number in a specific position, but then transitivity would be violated. For instance, if we use the first card: if a_1 > b_1, A wins; else B wins. But this is transitive only if the comparison is transitive. Wait, if we use the first card, then if a_1 > b_1 and b_1 > c_1, then a_1 > c_1, so A beats B and B beats C, so A should beat C. So this would also be transitive. But wait, but the problem says that the rule depends only on the relative order. If we fix a position, say the first card, then the rule is based on that position, which is part of the relative order. However, in this case, the rule is not based on the entire relative order of all 200 cards. It's only using one card. So this seems like a different rule.\n\n<contradiction> Wait, the problem states that the rule depends only on the relative order of the 200 cards. So if the rule is based only on the position of the cards, not their actual values, then for example, if we look at the first card of A and the first card of B, and compare them. But the problem is that the rule must also satisfy condition 2, which requires that if every a_i > b_i, then A wins. If we only look at the first card, then even if A's first card is not the maximum, as long as it's greater than B's first card, A would win. But in the scenario where a_i > b_i for all i, then a_1 > b_1, so A would win. So maybe a rule based on the first card where a card in A is greater than the corresponding card in B in the first position would work. But is this rule transitive?\n\n<case_analysis> Suppose we define the rule as follows: compare the first cards of A and B. If a_1 > b_1, A wins; else, B wins. Now, let's test transitivity. Suppose A beats B because a_1 > b_1, and B beats C because b_1 > c_1. Then, does A beat C? If a_1 > b_1 and b_1 > c_1, then a_1 > c_1, so A would beat C. So transitivity holds in this case. However, what if the first cards are equal? But since all numbers are real and distinct, the first cards can't be equal. Wait, but the actual numbers could be ordered in any way. Wait, but the rule only compares the first cards. So if A's first card is greater than B's first card, A wins; otherwise, B wins. But this is equivalent to a rule where the winner is the set whose maximum card is in the first position of the combined sorted list. Because if A's maximum is the overall maximum, then a_1 is the maximum, so a_1 > b_1 for all b in B, so A wins. Similarly, if B's maximum is in the first position, B wins. So this rule is essentially dictatorial, based on the maximum card. But there could be multiple maximum cards. Wait, but in the problem, each card has a unique real number, so there is a unique maximum. Therefore, the first card in the sorted list is the maximum. So the rule where the set containing the maximum card wins is the same as the dictatorial rule based on the first card.\n\n<consequence> So maybe the only transitive, position-based rules are dictatorial rules. Because any other rule that depends on more than one position would not necessarily be transitive. For example, if we use the maximum of the A set and the maximum of the B set and compare them. But the maximum of B is not necessarily the same as the first card. So if we use the maximum value in A and compare it to the maximum in B, but since the rule must depend only on the relative order, we can't reference actual values, only the positions. So if we use the maximum value, which is in some position k of A and some position m of B, but without knowing k and m, we can't compare them. Therefore, the rule must be based on some function of the positions. But if we use a position-based rule, like the k-th card, then transitivity might not hold. For example, if we use the first card, as before, it's dictatorial. If we use the second card, then even if A's second card is higher than B's first, and B's second card is higher than C's first, A's first card might not be higher than C's first, so A might lose to C. So the rule based on the second card is not transitive.\n\n<generalize> Therefore, perhaps the only transitive rules are dictatorial rules, where the winner is determined by the maximum card. But the problem says \"how many ways are there to define such a rule.\" If there is only one dictatorial rule, then the answer is 1. But wait, maybe there are other rules. For example, if we use a rule where the winner is the set with an odd number of elements greater than a certain value. But since the numbers are real and can be anywhere, that's not feasible. Alternatively, using some non-dictatorial function that still maintains transitivity.\n\n<alternative> Another approach: since the rule must be transitive, the relation must be a total order. However, in the context of sets, a total order would require that for any A and B, either A > B or B > A, which is possible if the rule is based on a linear extension of the card values. But the rule must be based only on the relative order of the 200 cards. So the only way to have a transitive relation is if the rule is equivalent to comparing the sets based on their maximum, or some other consistent criterion.\n\n<contradiction> Wait, suppose we have a rule that for any two sets A and B, the winner is the set whose maximum element is the highest among all elements in both sets. But since the rule must depend only on the relative order, not the actual values, we can think of it as comparing the maximum elements. If we use the maximum element of A and B, but we don't know which one is the actual maximum. Wait, but in the combined set of 200 cards, there is a unique maximum. So if we compare the maximum element of A and B, then the set containing the maximum element as per the combined order would be the winner. But how do we determine which set contains the maximum element? The maximum element is the 200th card when all are sorted. So if we look at the 200th card, it's the maximum. Then, the set that contains this card would be the winner. But then, if A has the 200th card, A wins; otherwise, B wins. But this is similar to the dictatorial rule where the winner is the set containing the maximum card, which is the 200th card in the sorted order. This is the same as the first card if we consider the relative order. Wait, no. If we look at the 200th card in the combined sorted order, that's the maximum. But in the rule, we compare the maximums of A and B. If the maximum of A is greater than the maximum of B, then A wins. But since the maximum of A is the overall maximum, it's greater than all elements in B, so A wins. So this rule is equivalent to the dictatorial rule based on the maximum card. Similarly, if we use the minimum card, it's the same idea.\n\n<equivalent> Therefore, any rule that depends on the maximum card of A or B would result in the same dictatorial rule. So if we fix a position k in the combined sorted order, and define the rule as the set whose k-th card is the maximum, then transitivity holds. But as we saw earlier, using a position other than the first or the maximum would break transitivity. For example, if we use the 100th card, but then if A's 100th card is higher than B's 100th card, but B's 100th card is higher than C's 100th card, A's 100th card might not be higher than C's 100th card, so the rule would be A beats C even though B beats A. Hence, such a rule is not transitive.\n\n<consequence> Therefore, the only way to have a transitive rule is to have a dictatorial rule, where the winner is determined by the maximum card. Since the maximum card is unique, the rule is to check which set contains the maximum card. If A contains the maximum, A wins; otherwise, B wins. This rule is transitive because if A contains the maximum, and B contains the maximum, then A and B both contain it, so A wins. If A and B have different maxima, then the rule is transitive. If B and C have different maxima, then B wins over A and C wins over B, so C wins over A. Hence, transitivity holds.\n\n<assumption> But are there other possible rules? For example, suppose we use a rule where the winner is the set that has more elements above a certain threshold. But the threshold is determined by the relative order. However, the threshold is not known in advance. So we can't set it based on actual values. The rule must be based only on the relative order. So if we set a threshold position k in the combined sorted order, and the winner is the set with more elements above position k. But this depends on k, which is arbitrary. However, the problem states that the rule must be based on the relative order of the 200 cards. So if we fix k, the rule is comparing the number of elements above k in A vs B. But this is not a total order because it's possible for A to have more above k than B, B to have more than C, but A not to have more than C. For example, suppose k=100. If A has 100 elements above 100, B has 99 above 100 and 1 below, C has 98 above 100 and 2 below. Then A beats B (100 > 99), B beats C (99 > 98), but A does not beat C (100 > 98). Thus, this rule is not transitive.\n\n<conclusion> Therefore, the only transitive rule that satisfies condition 2 is the dictatorial rule where the winner is the set containing the maximum card. Since the maximum card is the 200th card in the sorted order, the rule is equivalent to checking the last card. Therefore, there is only one such rule.\n\n<verify> Wait, but the problem states that the two players draw disjoint sets A and B. So the maximum card must be in either A or B. Therefore, the dictatorial rule where the set containing the maximum card wins is well-defined. There's only one way to define such a rule, which is to have the winner be the set containing the maximum card in the union of A and B. Since the maximum card is unique, this rule is uniquely determined. Hence, the number of ways is 1.\n</think>\nThe problem requires defining a rule to determine the winner between two sets \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) each containing 100 cards, based on the relative order of all 200 cards. The rule must satisfy three conditions: dependence on relative order, condition 2 where if every element of \\( A \\) is greater than \\( B \\)'s elements, \\( A \\) wins, and transitivity. \n\nKey steps:\n1. **Dependence on Relative Order**: The rule must be based only on the relative positions of the cards, not their actual values. This means the rule is a function of the permutation of the 200 cards.\n2. **Condition 2**: If \\( A = (a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{100}) \\) and \\( B = (b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_{100}) \\) with \\( a_i > b_i \\) for all \\( i \\), then \\( A \\) wins. This resembles a dominant sequence.\n3. **Transitivity**: The rule must be transitive, meaning if \\( A \\) beats \\( B \\) and \\( B \\) beats \\( C \\), then \\( A \\) must beat \\( C \\).\n\nConsidering these conditions, the only way to ensure transitivity and satisfy condition 2 is to use a **dictatorial rule**. This rule depends on a specific card's value. The most straightforward dictatorial rule is based on the maximum card. Since the maximum card is unique, the rule can be defined as follows: the set containing the maximum card in the combined set of 200 cards wins. This rule is transitive because if \\( A \\) contains the maximum, \\( B \\) cannot contain the maximum, and vice versa. \n\nAny other transitive rule would require comparing multiple cards, which can lead to non-transitive outcomes. For example, comparing the maximum of each set fails transitivity. Therefore, the only valid rule is the dictatorial one based on the maximum card.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]",
                "reasoning": "<assumption> The problem is about determining the number of ways to define a rule that satisfies three specific conditions related to card sets A and B. Let me break down each condition and see how they interact.\n\nFirst, the setup: an infinite deck of cards with each real number exactly once. Two players each draw 100 cards, forming sets A and B. The rule to decide the winner must depend only on the relative order of the 200 cards, not their actual values. Also, if in the ordered list, every element of A is greater than the corresponding element in B when both are sorted, then A should win. Additionally, the rule must be transitive: if A beats B and B beats C, then A must beat C.\n\n<equivalent> Condition 2 reminds me of a concept in order theory called a \" comparing sequences.\" The idea that A beats B when A's elements are all greater than B's when both are sorted. This is similar to a dominant sequence. Condition 3 suggests transitivity, which is a key property of a total order, but since we're dealing with subsets, it's more about a tournament graph being transitive.\n\n<analogy> This seems similar to voting systems or comparing ranked candidates where the outcome is transitive. In transitive tournaments, the outcomes form a total order. However, here we are dealing with subsets, not individual candidates. Maybe each card can be assigned a value, and the rule is based on some total order that extends the ranking.\n\n<constraint> The rule must be based only on the relative order, so the actual numbers on the cards don't matter, just their sequence. That means the rule must be a function of the permutation of the union of A and B. Also, transitivity is crucial. So, the rule must define a transitive relation over all possible A and B.\n\n<generalize> If the rule is based on some total order of all real numbers, then for any two sets A and B, we can compare them by looking at their ordered elements. However, the problem states that the rule depends only on the relative order of the 200 cards. So, the total order of all reals is unnecessary; instead, the rule uses the relative positions of the 200 cards. But wait, the total order of all reals would allow comparing any two cards, but here the rule is based on the relative order within A and B. Hmm, maybe the rule is equivalent to a linear extension of the partial order defined by the relative positions.\n\n<contradiction> If the rule is based only on the relative order, then two different orderings of the same set of 200 cards could lead to different winners. But the rule must be consistent. For example, if in one ordering A beats B, and in another ordering, B beats A, then the rule is invalid. Therefore, the rule must assign a winner in such a way that the relation is transitive.\n\n<case_analysis> Let's consider small cases first. Suppose instead of 100 cards each, we had 1 card each. Then, the rule would be that the single card in A beats the single card in B if it's the larger one. But transitivity would require that if A beats B and B beats C, then A beats C. This is possible if the rule is based on the actual values, but since the rule must depend only on the relative order, how can we define it? If we order the three cards and compare them pairwise, but the problem is that the rule has to be consistent across all possible pair comparisons.\n\n<equivalent> Wait, if the rule must be transitive, then the relation must be a total order. But since the rule is based only on the relative order of the 200 cards, the only way the relation is transitive is if the rule is equivalent to a linear extension of the partial order defined by the relative positions. However, the set of all possible 200-card combinations is too large to be a total order. But the problem states that the rule is defined for any A and B, so the rule must be a function that, given any two sets A and B, outputs a winner based on their relative order, and this function must be transitive.\n\n<assumption> Maybe the rule is equivalent to a social choice function that is transitive. In social choice theory, a transitive social welfare function is a dictatorship. But here, with 100 subsets each time, perhaps the rule is dictatorial. That is, one player's set is chosen based on some fixed ordering.\n\n<inference> If the rule is dictatorial, then there exists a specific card whose value determines the winner. For example, suppose the rule is that the player whose highest card is the maximum in all 200 cards wins. But wait, if we don't know the actual values, but only the relative order, then the maximum in the combined 200 cards is the highest card. So if one set has the highest card, they win. But condition 2 says that if in the ordered A and B, every a_i > b_i, then A wins. However, the maximum card in the combined set could be in A or B. If the maximum is in A, then a_1 is the maximum, so a_1 > all other cards including b_1. Therefore, since a_i > b_i for all i, including i=1, so a_1 > b_1, which satisfies condition 2. So if the rule is that the set with the maximum card wins, then condition 2 is satisfied. Also, transitivity would hold because if A has a higher maximum than B, and B has a higher maximum than C, then A has a higher maximum than C, so the rule is transitive.\n\n<verify> So a dictatorial rule where the winner is the set containing the maximum card in the union would satisfy all three conditions. But are there other possible rules? Suppose there are two possible winners sometimes. For example, if the rule is based on who has the higher number in a specific position, but then transitivity would be violated. For instance, if we use the first card: if a_1 > b_1, A wins; else B wins. But this is transitive only if the comparison is transitive. Wait, if we use the first card, then if a_1 > b_1 and b_1 > c_1, then a_1 > c_1, so A beats B and B beats C, so A should beat C. So this would also be transitive. But wait, but the problem says that the rule depends only on the relative order. If we fix a position, say the first card, then the rule is based on that position, which is part of the relative order. However, in this case, the rule is not based on the entire relative order of all 200 cards. It's only using one card. So this seems like a different rule.\n\n<contradiction> Wait, the problem states that the rule depends only on the relative order of the 200 cards. So if the rule is based only on the position of the cards, not their actual values, then for example, if we look at the first card of A and the first card of B, and compare them. But the problem is that the rule must also satisfy condition 2, which requires that if every a_i > b_i, then A wins. If we only look at the first card, then even if A's first card is not the maximum, as long as it's greater than B's first card, A would win. But in the scenario where a_i > b_i for all i, then a_1 > b_1, so A would win. So maybe a rule based on the first card where a card in A is greater than the corresponding card in B in the first position would work. But is this rule transitive?\n\n<case_analysis> Suppose we define the rule as follows: compare the first cards of A and B. If a_1 > b_1, A wins; else, B wins. Now, let's test transitivity. Suppose A beats B because a_1 > b_1, and B beats C because b_1 > c_1. Then, does A beat C? If a_1 > b_1 and b_1 > c_1, then a_1 > c_1, so A would beat C. So transitivity holds in this case. However, what if the first cards are equal? But since all numbers are real and distinct, the first cards can't be equal. Wait, but the actual numbers could be ordered in any way. Wait, but the rule only compares the first cards. So if A's first card is greater than B's first card, A wins; otherwise, B wins. But this is equivalent to a rule where the winner is the set whose maximum card is in the first position of the combined sorted list. Because if A's maximum is the overall maximum, then a_1 is the maximum, so a_1 > b_1 for all b in B, so A wins. Similarly, if B's maximum is in the first position, B wins. So this rule is essentially dictatorial, based on the maximum card. But there could be multiple maximum cards. Wait, but in the problem, each card has a unique real number, so there is a unique maximum. Therefore, the first card in the sorted list is the maximum. So the rule where the set containing the maximum card wins is the same as the dictatorial rule based on the first card.\n\n<consequence> So maybe the only transitive, position-based rules are dictatorial rules. Because any other rule that depends on more than one position would not necessarily be transitive. For example, if we use the maximum of the A set and the maximum of the B set and compare them. But the maximum of B is not necessarily the same as the first card. So if we use the maximum value in A and compare it to the maximum in B, but since the rule must depend only on the relative order, we can't reference actual values, only the positions. So if we use the maximum value, which is in some position k of A and some position m of B, but without knowing k and m, we can't compare them. Therefore, the rule must be based on some function of the positions. But if we use a position-based rule, like the k-th card, then transitivity might not hold. For example, if we use the first card, as before, it's dictatorial. If we use the second card, then even if A's second card is higher than B's first, and B's second card is higher than C's first, A's first card might not be higher than C's first, so A might lose to C. So the rule based on the second card is not transitive.\n\n<generalize> Therefore, perhaps the only transitive rules are dictatorial rules, where the winner is determined by the maximum card. But the problem says \"how many ways are there to define such a rule.\" If there is only one dictatorial rule, then the answer is 1. But wait, maybe there are other rules. For example, if we use a rule where the winner is the set with an odd number of elements greater than a certain value. But since the numbers are real and can be anywhere, that's not feasible. Alternatively, using some non-dictatorial function that still maintains transitivity.\n\n<alternative> Another approach: since the rule must be transitive, the relation must be a total order.

But the rule must be based only on the relative order of the 200 cards. So the only way to have a transitive relation is if the rule is equivalent to comparing the sets based on their maximum, or some other consistent criterion.\n\n<contradiction> Wait, suppose we have a rule that for any two sets A and B, the winner is the set whose maximum element is the highest among all elements in both sets. But since the rule must depend only on the relative order, not the actual values, we can think of it as comparing the maximum elements. If we use the maximum element of A and B, but we don't know which one is the actual maximum. Wait, but in the combined set of 200 cards, there is a unique maximum. So if we compare the maximum element of A and B, then the set containing the maximum element as per the combined order would be the winner. But how do we determine which set contains the maximum element? The maximum element is the 200th card when all are sorted. So if we look at the 200th card, it's the maximum. Then, the set that contains this card would be the winner. But then, if A has the 200th card, A wins; otherwise, B wins. But this is similar to the dictatorial rule where the winner is the set containing the maximum card, which is the 200th card in the sorted order. This is the same as the first card if we consider the relative order. Wait, no. If we look at the 200th card in the combined sorted order, that's the maximum.

If B and C have different maxima, then B wins over A and C wins over B, so C wins over A. Hence, transitivity holds.\n\n<assumption> But are there other possible rules? For example, suppose we use a rule where the winner is the set that has more elements above a certain threshold. But the threshold is determined by the relative order. However, the threshold is not known in advance. So we can't set it based on actual values. The rule must be based only on the relative order. So if we set a threshold position k in the combined sorted order, and the winner is the set with more elements above position k. But this depends on k, which is arbitrary. However, the problem states that the rule must be based on the relative order of the 200 cards. So if we fix k, the rule is comparing the number of elements above k in A vs B. But this is not a total order because it's possible for A to have more above k than B, B to have more than C, but A not to have more than C. For example, suppose k=100. If A has 100 elements above 100, B has 99 above 100 and 1 below, C has 98 above 100 and 2 below. Then A beats B (100 > 99), B beats C (99 > 98), but A does not beat C (100 > 98). Thus, this rule is not transitive.\n\n<conclusion> Therefore, the only transitive rule that satisfies condition 2 is the dictatorial rule where the winner is the set containing the maximum card.

We need to find k \u2264 1 (so k=1) and two distinct integers x\u2081, x\u2082 such that P(x\u2081) = P(x\u2082). But since P is linear and monic, it's strictly increasing (if c is fixed), so P(x\u2081) = P(x\u2082) implies x\u2081 = x\u2082, which contradicts the distinctness. Therefore, for n=1, the condition fails. Hence, n=1 is not a solution.\n</verify>\n\n<complete>\nWait, but hold on. For n=1, the polynomial is linear: P(x) = x + c. The problem requires that for every such P, there exists k \u2264 1 and k+1 distinct integers where the sum of k terms equals the (k+1)th term. Since k must be 1, we need two distinct integers x\u2081 and x\u2082 such that P(x\u2081) = P(x\u2082). But as P is linear and monic, it's injective over integers (since if x\u2081 \u2260 x\u2082, then P(x\u2081) \u2260 P(x\u2082)). Therefore, it's impossible. Hence, n=1 does not satisfy the condition.\n</think>\nTo determine all positive integers \\( n \\) satisfying the given condition, we analyze the problem by considering monic polynomials of degree at most \\( n \\) with integer coefficients.

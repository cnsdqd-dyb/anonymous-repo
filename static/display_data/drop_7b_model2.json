Then, the Texans respond with Vonta Leach getting a 1-yard touchdown run. So after the first quarter, both teams are tied at 7-0? Wait, no, touchdowns are worth 6 points each. So Raiders have one touchdown (6 points) and the Texans have another touchdown (6 points). So after the first quarter, it's a tie at 6-6? Wait, but field goals and touchdowns contribute to the score. Wait, first quarter would have the Raiders scoring a touchdown (7 points including the extra point) and the Texans scoring a touchdown (7 points). So 7-7 after the first quarter? Wait, but the scoring details might have more field goals. Wait, no, the passage says that after the Raiders scored the touchdown, the Texans scored a 1-yard touchdown. Then the Raiders answered with field goals. Wait, let me read the passage again carefully.\n\n\"Oakland would get the early lead in the first quarter as quarterback JaMarcus Russell completed a 20-yard touchdown pass to rookie wide receiver Chaz Schilens.

The Texans tried to rally in the fourth quarter as Brown nailed a 40-yard field goal, yet the Raiders' defense would shut down any possible attempt.\"\n\nSo, let's break it down quarter by quarter.\n\nFirst Quarter:\n\nOakland scores a touchdown with a 20-yard TD pass. The standard scoring includes the touchdown and the extra point (7 points). Then the Texans score a touchdown run (6 points). Then Raiders kick two field goals: 33 yards and 30 yards. Each field goal is 3 points, so that's 3*2=6 points. So after the first quarter:\n\nOakland has 7 (TD) + 6 (field goals) = 13 points. But wait, after the touchdown, there's an extra point, so 7, then field goals add 3 each. But do the field goals happen after the scores? The passage says the Raiders \"answered with kicker Sebastian Janikowski getting a 33-yard and a 30-yard field goal.\" So those field goals would be after the Texans scored. So the flow is Raiders TD (7), then Texans TD (7), then Raiders field goals (3+3=6). So total after first quarter:\n\nOakland: 7 (TD) + 3 (field goal) + 3 (field goal) = 13.\n\nWait, no, the field goals would be part of the play after the initial scores. Wait, the passage says \"the Raiders would answer with kicker Sebastian Janikowski getting a 33-yard and a 30-yard field goal.\" So that would be after the Texans scored their TD. So in the first quarter, the scoring would be:\n\nOakland: TD (7) + extra point (1) = 8? Or just TD (7). Wait, typically after a touchdown, the extra point is an automatic one, but sometimes teams can attempt the 2-point conversion, but in the absence of info, we'll assume it's a 1-point conversion. So that would make Oakland have 7 points from the TD. Then the Texans score a TD (7). Then Raiders kick two field goals (3 each) after their TD, so that would be 7 + 3 + 3 = 13. So after the first quarter, Raiders have 13, Texans have 7.\n\nThen the second quarter: Houston ties the game with Kris Brown getting a 53-yard and a 24-yard field goal. So that's 3 points each, so 3 + 3 = 6 points. So each field goal is 3 points, right? Wait, kickers make field goals worth 3 points, so two field goals would be 6 points. So after their score, the game is tied at 13-13.\n\nThird quarter: Oakland scores again. First, a 29-yard touchdown pass (7 points), then an 80-yard punt return for a touchdown (7 points). So that's two TDs from Oakland. So 7 +7 =14 points. They add their kicker's points? Wait, kicker's points here are not mentioned. The passage says \"wide receiver Johnnie Lee Higgins catching a 29-yard touchdown pass from Russell\" and \"followed up by an 80-yard punt return for a touchdown.\" So those are the scores. So each touchdown is 7 points. So Oakland adds 14 points in the third quarter. So their total would be 13 (from first quarter) +14=27. Then they also have any other points? The passage says \"the Raiders' defense would shut down any possible attempt,\" so no other scores. So Oakland has 27.\n\nThen the fourth quarter: The Texans try to rally with Brown's 40-yard field goal (3 points). So they go up by 3 to 27 vs. 13? Wait, no. Wait, after third quarter, Raiders are at 27, and after the second quarter, the score was 13-13. Then in the third quarter, Raiders score 14, making it 27-13. Then in the fourth quarter, the Texans kick a field goal to tie again at 27-26? Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nAfter first quarter: Raiders 13, Texans 7.\n\nSecond quarter: Houston ties with 13-13 by scoring two field goals (6 points). Third quarter: Raiders score two TDs (each 7, total 14) making it 27-13. Then in the fourth quarter, the Texans kick a field goal (3 points) to make it 27-16. But Raiders' defense shuts down any attempts, so no more scores. So final score would be Raiders 27, Texans 16. Therefore, Raiders win.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let's list each scoring event with points:\n\nFirst Quarter:\n\n1. Raiders TD (7)\n2. Texans TD (7)\n3. Raiders field goals x2 (3 each, total 6)\n   - So Raiders total after first quarter: 7 +6 =13\n   - Texans total after first quarter:7\n\nSecond Quarter:\n\n1. Houston field goals x2 (3 each, total 6)\n   - Raiders still 13\n   - Texans 7+6=13\n\nThird Quarter:\n\n1. Raiders TD (7)\n2. Raiders TD (7)\n   - Raiders total:13+14=27\n3. No other points\n\nFourth Quarter:\n\n1. Houston field goal (3)\n   - Raiders 27\n   - Texans 13+3=16\n\nSo final score Raiders 27, Texans 16. Therefore, Raiders won.\n</think>\nThe Raiders won the game with a final score of 27-16.\n\n\\boxed{Oakland}",

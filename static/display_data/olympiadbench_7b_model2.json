        "full_response": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking for all positive integers \\( n \\) such that for every monic polynomial \\( P \\) of degree at most \\( n \\) with integer coefficients, there exists a positive integer \\( k \\leq n \\) and \\( k+1 \\) distinct integers \\( x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_{k+1} \\) satisfying the equation:\n\n\\[\nP(x_1) + P(x_2) + \\cdots + P(x_k) = P(x_{k+1})\n\\]\n\nFirst, let's parse the problem statement to make sure I understand it correctly. We need to find all positive integers \\( n \\) where the condition holds for every monic polynomial \\( P \\) of degree at most \\( n \\) with integer coefficients. The key points are:\n\n1. \\( P \\) is monic with integer coefficients.\n2. \\( k \\leq n \\).\n3. There must exist \\( k+1 \\) distinct integers \\( x_1, \\ldots, x_{k+1} \\) such that the sum of \\( P \\) evaluated at the first \\( k \\) integers equals \\( P \\) evaluated at the last one.\n\nThe problem is asking for all such \\( n \\). So, first, let's consider small values of \\( n \\) and see if the condition holds or fails. That might help us spot a pattern or come up with a conjecture.\n\n**Case n = 1:**\n\nFor \\( n = 1 \\), we need to check if every monic linear polynomial (degree 1) with integer coefficients satisfies the condition. Let \\( P(x) = x + c \\), where \\( c \\) is an integer.\n\nWe need to find \\( k \\leq 1 \\), so \\( k = 1 \\). Then, we need 2 distinct integers \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\) such that \\( P(x_1) = P(x_2) \\). However, since \\( P \\) is linear and strictly increasing (as the coefficient of \\( x \\) is 1, which is positive), \\( P(x_1) = P(x_2) \\) implies \\( x_1 = x_2 \\), which contradicts the requirement that they are distinct. Therefore, for \\( n = 1 \\), the condition fails. So \\( n = 1 \\) is not a solution.\n\nWait, but hold on. The problem says \"for every monic polynomial of degree at most \\( n \\)\". So for \\( n = 1 \\), the polynomials we have to consider are constants and linear polynomials. But since \\( k \\leq 1 \\), and for linear polynomials, we can't find two distinct integers with the same \\( P(x) \\). However, maybe the problem is considering degree at most \\( n \\), so including degree 0. For \\( P \\) being a constant polynomial, say \\( P(x) = c \\). Then, for any \\( k \\leq 1 \\), say \\( k = 1 \\), we need \\( 1 + 1 = 2 \\) distinct integers where \\( P(x_1) = P(x_2) \\). But since \\( P \\) is constant, \\( P(x_1) = P(x_2) \\) for any \\( x_1, x_2 \\), so that's trivially true. Therefore, for constant polynomials, \\( k = 1 \\) works, but for linear polynomials, \\( k = 1 \\) doesn't work. However, since the problem states \"for every monic polynomial of degree at most \\( n \\)\", and constant polynomials are allowed, but we cannot guarantee that all linear polynomials (or constant polynomials) satisfy the condition. Wait, but the problem is not saying \"for all polynomials\" but \"for every monic polynomial\". So both constant and linear are monic (if constant, then the degree is 0, which is allowed since n=1, and \"monic\" for a degree 0 polynomial is just a constant polynomial). So if a monic polynomial can have degree 0 or 1, but when it's degree 1, we cannot find such \\( x_1, x_2 \\). Therefore, \\( n = 1 \\) fails because there exists a monic polynomial (of degree 1) where the condition is not met. Therefore, \\( n = 1 \\) is not a solution.\n\n**Case n = 2:**\n\nNow, for \\( n = 2 \\), we need to check if every monic polynomial of degree at most 2 (i.e., quadratic) satisfies the condition. For \\( k \\leq 2 \\), so \\( k = 1 \\) or \\( k = 2 \\). We need to check if for every monic quadratic polynomial \\( P \\) with integer coefficients, there exists \\( k \\leq 2 \\) and \\( k + 1 \\) distinct integers such that the sum of \\( k \\) evaluations equals the \\( (k+1)\\)-th evaluation.\n\nFirst, let's check for \\( k = 1 \\). For \\( k = 1 \\), we need 2 distinct integers \\( x_1, x_2 \\) such that \\( P(x_1) = P(x_2) \\). Since \\( P \\) is a quadratic polynomial, it is a parabola. If it's not symmetric (i.e., not a constant), it is symmetric about its vertex. Therefore, for any quadratic polynomial, there exists a pair of distinct integers symmetric about the vertex's x-coordinate that map to the same value. However, since we need integers, unless the vertex is at a half-integer, there might be such pairs. But even if the vertex is not at a half-integer, we can still have integer points symmetric around the vertex. Wait, let's think.\n\nSuppose the vertex of the quadratic \\( P(x) = x^2 + bx + c \\) is at \\( x = -b/2 \\). If \\( b \\) is even, then the vertex is at an integer, and then the points \\( x \\) and \\( -x - b \\) will be symmetric around the vertex and will have the same value. But if \\( b \\) is odd, then the vertex is at a half-integer. However, even in that case, we can still find integers \\( x \\) such that \\( x \\) and \\( -x - b \\) are distinct integers. Wait, but \\( x \\) and \\( -x - b \\) are distinct unless \\( 2x + b = 0 \\), which would mean \\( x = -b/2 \\). But if \\( b \\) is odd, then \\( x \\) is not an integer. So in that case, the symmetric points around the vertex are non-integer, but we need integer points. Therefore, even if the vertex is at a half-integer, there might not be two integer points equidistant from the vertex. For example, take \\( P(x) = x^2 + x \\). The vertex is at \\( x = -1/2 \\). Then, is there an integer \\( x \\) such that \\( P(x) = P(-1 - x) \\)? Let's check:\n\nCompute \\( P(-1 - x) = (-1 - x)^2 + (-1 - x) = (1 + 2x + x^2) -1 -x = x^2 + x = P(x) \\). So \\( P(-1 - x) = P(x) \\). Therefore, even when the vertex is at a half-integer, if \\( x \\) is integer, then \\( P(-1 - x) = P(x) \\). Therefore, for any quadratic \\( P(x) = x^2 + bx + c \\), we can take \\( x \\) and \\( -b -x \\) as the two integers such that \\( P(x) = P(-b -x) \\). Therefore, even when \\( b \\) is odd, there exist two integers \\( x \\) and \\( -b -x \\) (which are distinct as long as \\( x \\) is not fixed by the symmetry). Since \\( x \\) can be chosen such that \\( x \\neq (-b -x) \\), which implies \\( 2x + b \\neq 0 \\), so as long as \\( x \\) is not \\( -b/2 \\), but since \\( x \\) must be an integer, if \\( b \\) is even, then \\( x \\) can be any integer, and \\( -b -x \\) is distinct from \\( x \\). If \\( b \\) is odd, then \\( x \\) is an integer, and \\( -b -x \\) is also an integer, and \\( x \\neq -b -x \\) since \\( 2x + b = 0 \\) would require \\( x = -b/2 \\), which is not an integer if \\( b \\) is odd. Therefore, for any quadratic polynomial, \\( k = 1 \\) suffices, and we can always find such a pair.\n\nTherefore, for \\( n = 2 \\), even though some polynomials may require \\( k = 2 \\), but in fact, for quadratic polynomials, \\( k = 1 \\) works because we can always find two integers \\( x_1, x_2 \\) such that \\( P(x_1) = P(x_2) \\). Therefore, \\( n = 2 \\) works. Wait, but wait. Let's check with a specific example. Take \\( P(x) = x^2 \\). Then \\( P(x) = P(-x) \\), so \\( x_1 = 1 \\), \\( x_2 = -1 \\), so indeed, \\( P(1) = P(-1) \\). Similarly, for \\( P(x) = x^2 + x \\), as I checked before, choosing \\( x = 0 \\), then \\( P(0) = 0 \\), \\( P(-1 -0) = P(-1) = (-1)^2 + (-1) = 1 - 1 = 0 \\), so yes, that works. So even when the polynomial isn't even, we can still find such a pair. Therefore, \\( k = 1 \\) works for all quadratics. So maybe \\( n = 2 \\) is acceptable.\n\nBut wait, hold on. The problem states \"for every monic polynomial of degree at most \\( n \\)\". So for \\( n = 2 \\), polynomials can be linear or constant. But we saw that linear polynomials can't have \\( k = 1 \\) since they are injective. However, but quadratic polynomials can use \\( k = 1 \\), but if there are linear polynomials, does that affect the condition?\n\nWait, the problem states: \"for every monic polynomial \\( P \\) of degree at most \\( n \\) with integer coefficients\". So, if \\( n = 2 \\), we need the condition to hold for all such polynomials, including linear ones. However, linear polynomials, as we saw earlier, require \\( k = 1 \\), which doesn't work because \\( x_1 = x_2 \\) is needed, but they need to be distinct. Therefore, for linear polynomials, the condition fails. But the problem says \"for every monic polynomial of degree at most \\( n \\)\"... So even if \\( n = 2 \\), there are polynomials (the linear ones) where the condition fails. Therefore, \\( n = 2 \\) doesn't work.\n\nWait, this seems contradictory. Wait, no. Wait, when \\( n = 2 \\), the problem is to satisfy that condition for every monic polynomial of degree at most 2. But some of those polynomials are linear, and for them, \\( k = 1 \\) would require two distinct integers with the same polynomial value, which is impossible because linear polynomials are injective. Therefore, for \\( n = 2 \\), since there exist monic polynomials (degree 1) where the condition fails, \\( n = 2 \\) is not a solution. Wait, but earlier reasoning suggested that quadratics can use \\( k = 1 \\), but linear polynomials cannot. But since the problem requires that the condition holds for all polynomials of degree at most \\( n \\), even if one polynomial fails, then \\( n \\) is invalid. Therefore, \\( n = 2 \\) is invalid because of the linear polynomials. So then, maybe the only possible \\( n \\) is when \\( n \\geq 2 \\) but including higher degrees? Wait, but let's think again.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-examine the problem statement: \"Determine all positive integers \\( n \\) satisfying the following condition: for every monic polynomial \\( P \\) of degree at most \\( n \\) with integer coefficients, there exists a positive integer \\( k \\leq n \\), and \\( k+1 \\) distinct integers \\( x_1, \\ldots, x_{k+1} \\) such that \\( P(x_1) + \\cdots + P(x_k) = P(x_{k+1}) \\).\"\n\nSo for each \\( P \\), you can choose \\( k \\leq n \\). So for each \\( P \\), if \\( k = 1 \\) is sufficient, then it's okay. But for some polynomials, \\( k = 1 \\) may not work, but \\( k = 2 \\) might. So perhaps even though some polynomials (like linear) can't be handled with \\( k = 1 \\), maybe they can be handled with a larger \\( k \\). Therefore, perhaps \\( n = 2 \\) works because even though linear polynomials need \\( k = 1 \\), which is impossible, maybe they can use \\( k = 2 \\).\n\nWait, so for a linear polynomial \\( P(x) = x + c \\), we need \\( k \\leq 2 \\). So for \\( k = 1 \\), impossible as before, but for \\( k = 2 \\), we need 3 distinct integers such that \\( P(x_1) + P(x_2) = P(x_3) \\).\n\nGiven that \\( P(x) = x + c \\), then:\n\n\\( (x_1 + c) + (x_2 + c) = x_3 + c \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( x_1 + x_2 + 2c = x_3 + c \\)\n\n\\( x_1 + x_2 + c = x_3 \\)\n\nTherefore, we need to find three distinct integers \\( x_1, x_2, x_3 \\) such that \\( x_3 = x_1 + x_2 + c \\).\n\nSince \\( c \\) is an integer (because the polynomial has integer coefficients), and \\( x_1, x_2, x_3 \\) are distinct integers. So is this possible?\n\nFor example, let's take \\( c = 0 \\), so \\( P(x) = x \\). Then we need \\( x_3 = x_1 + x_2 \\). So we need three distinct integers where one is the sum of the other two. For example, take \\( x_1 = 1 \\), \\( x_2 = 2 \\), then \\( x_3 = 3 \\). So yes, that works. Similarly, for any linear polynomial \\( P(x) = x + c \\), can we find such integers?\n\nLet me choose \\( x_1 = 0 \\), \\( x_2 = 1 \\). Then \\( x_3 = 0 + 1 + c = 1 + c \\). So we need \\( x_3 \\) to be distinct from \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\). So as long as \\( 1 + c \\) is not equal to 0 or 1. But \\( c \\) is an integer. If \\( c = 0 \\), then \\( x_3 = 1 \\), which is equal to \\( x_2 \\), which is not allowed. If \\( c = -1 \\), then \\( x_3 = 0 \\), equal to \\( x_1 \\). If \\( c = 1 \\), \\( x_3 = 2 \\), which is distinct from \\( x_1 = 0 \\), \\( x_2 = 1 \\). So in that case, it works. However, if \\( c = -2 \\), then \\( x_3 = -1 \\), which is distinct from 0 and 1. So perhaps even if \\( c = 0 \\), if I choose different \\( x_1, x_2 \\). For \\( c = 0 \\), \\( x_3 = x_1 + x_2 \\). So if I choose \\( x_1 = 1 \\), \\( x_2 = 2 \\), then \\( x_3 = 3 \\). That's distinct. So even if \\( c = 0 \\), we can choose \\( x_1 = 1 \\), \\( x_2 = 2 \\), giving \\( x_3 = 3 \\). So perhaps, for linear polynomials, even though \\( k = 1 \\) is impossible, \\( k = 2 \\) works. Therefore, maybe \\( n = 2 \\) is acceptable.\n\nWait, but wait. Let's formalize this. For a linear polynomial \\( P(x) = x + c \\), we need to find three distinct integers \\( x_1, x_2, x_3 \\) such that \\( x_3 = x_1 + x_2 + c \\). Is this always possible?\n\nSuppose we fix \\( x_1 = t \\) and \\( x_2 = t + 1 \\). Then \\( x_3 = t + (t + 1) + c = 2t + 1 + c \\). We need to ensure that \\( x_3 \\) is distinct from \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\). So \\( 2t + 1 + c \\neq t \\) and \\( 2t + 1 + c \\neq t + 1 \\). The first inequality: \\( 2t + 1 + c \\neq t \\) implies \\( t + 1 + c \\neq 0 \\), so \\( t \\neq -c - 1 \\). The second inequality: \\( 2t + 1 + c \\neq t + 1 \\) implies \\( t + c \\neq 0 \\), so \\( t \\neq -c \\).\n\nSo as long as we can choose \\( t \\) such that \\( t \\neq -c -1 \\) and \\( t \\neq -c \\), then \\( x_3 \\) will be distinct from \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\). Since integers are infinite, there are infinitely many \\( t \\) to choose from, so we can always find such a \\( t \\). For example, choose \\( t = 0 \\). Then \\( x_3 = 0 + 1 + c = 1 + c \\). If \\( c = 0 \\), then \\( x_3 = 1 \\), which is equal to \\( x_2 = 1 \\). So that's a problem. But if \\( c \\neq 0 \\), \\( x_3 = 1 + c \\) which is distinct from \\( x_1 = 0 \\) and \\( x_2 = 1 \\). Wait, but if \\( c = 0 \\), then \\( x_3 = 1 \\), which is equal to \\( x_2 = 1 \\). Therefore, if \\( c = 0 \\), this choice fails. So in that case, we need to choose a different \\( t \\). For example, take \\( t = 2 \\). Then \\( x_3 = 2 + 3 + c = 5 + c \\). For \\( c = 0 \\), \\( x_3 = 5 \\), which is distinct from 0, 1, 2. So perhaps even if \\( c = 0 \\), we can choose a different \\( t \\). Let's see.\n\nSo in the case \\( c = 0 \\), \\( x_1 = 2 \\), \\( x_2 = 3 \\), then \\( x_3 = 2 + 3 + 0 = 5 \\). So \\( x_3 = 5 \\), which is distinct from 2 and 3. So yes, even for \\( c = 0 \\), we can find such \\( t \\).\n\nTherefore, even for linear polynomials, even though \\( k = 1 \\) fails, \\( k = 2 \\) works. Therefore, for \\( n = 2 \\), since all monic polynomials of degree at most 2 (quadratic and linear) can be handled with \\( k = 2 \\), then \\( n = 2 \\) is acceptable.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose the linear polynomial is \\( P(x) = x + c \\). Then, for any such polynomial, the equation \\( P(x_1) + P(x_2) = P(x_3) \\) reduces to \\( x_1 + x_2 + 2c = x_3 + c \\), so \\( x_3 = x_1 + x_2 + c \\). We need three distinct integers \\( x_1, x_2, x_3 \\). As we saw, choosing \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\) sufficiently apart can ensure that \\( x_3 \\) is distinct from both. So, as long as \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\) are chosen such that \\( x_3 \\) isn't equal to either. Since there are infinitely many integers, we can always find such \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\). Therefore, for linear polynomials, even though \\( k = 1 \\) fails, \\( k = 2 \\) works. Hence, \\( n = 2 \\) is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, maybe \\( n = 2 \\) works. Now, what about \\( n = 3 \\)? Let's check.\n\n**Case n = 3:**\n\nFor \\( n = 3 \\), we need to check if every monic polynomial of degree at most 3 (cubic, quadratic, linear, or constant) can have \\( k \\leq 3 \\) such that \\( k+1 \\) distinct integers \\( x_1, \\ldots, x_{k+1} \\) satisfy the equation.\n\nSimilarly, for quadratic and cubic polynomials, even if \\( k = 1 \\) works (for quadratics as they are not injective), but for cubics, we need to check if \\( k = 1 \\) is always possible.\n\nWait, a cubic polynomial can be injective or not. Wait, over integers, injectivity of polynomials is different. In fact, a polynomial of odd degree is not injective over integers because they tend to negative and positive infinity. Wait, actually, for integer polynomials, being injective is tricky. For example, \\( x^3 \\) is injective over integers because if \\( x_1^3 = x_2^3 \\), then \\( x_1 = x_2 \\). So in that case, \\( P(x) = x^3 \\) is injective over integers. So in this case, \\( k = 1 \\) would require two distinct integers with the same value, which is impossible for injective functions. Therefore, for \\( P(x) = x^3 \\), \\( k = 1 \\) is impossible. Then, can we use \\( k = 2 \\) or \\( k = 3 \\)?\n\nSo for \\( P(x) = x^3 \\), we need \\( k \\leq 3 \\), so \\( k = 2 \\) or \\( k = 3 \\).\n\nFirst, let's check \\( k = 2 \\). Then, we need 3 distinct integers \\( x_1, x_2, x_3 \\) such that \\( P(x_1) + P(x_2) = P(x_3) \\). So:\n\n\\( x_1^3 + x_2^3 = x_3^3 \\)\n\nBut by Fermat's Last Theorem for the equation \\( a^3 + b^3 = c^3 \\), there are no positive integers \\( a, b, c \\) satisfying this. However, in our case, the integers can be negative. So maybe there are solutions with negative integers?\n\nWait, suppose \\( x_1 = 1 \\), \\( x_2 = -1 \\). Then \\( 1^3 + (-1)^3 = 0 = x_3^3 \\), so \\( x_3 = 0 \\). Therefore, \\( x_3 = 0 \\), which is distinct from 1 and -1. Therefore, \\( x_1 = 1 \\), \\( x_2 = -1 \\), \\( x_3 = 0 \\) gives \\( 1^3 + (-1)^3 = 0^3 \\), which works. Therefore, for the cubic \\( P(x) = x^3 \\), with \\( k = 2 \\), there exists a solution. So \\( k = 2 \\) works here.\n\nAlternatively, even if we take \\( x_1 = a \\), \\( x_2 = -a \\), then \\( P(x_1) + P(x_2) = a^3 + (-a)^3 = 0 = P(0) \\). So that's a valid solution as long as 0 is distinct from \\( a \\) and \\( -a \\). Since \\( a \\neq 0 \\), then \\( a \\), \\( -a \\), and 0 are distinct. Therefore, for any non-zero integer \\( a \\), choosing \\( x_1 = a \\), \\( x_2 = -a \\), \\( x_3 = 0 \\) satisfies the condition. Therefore, for \\( P(x) = x^3 \\), \\( k = 2 \\) works. Therefore, even though \\( k = 1 \\) fails, \\( k = 2 \\) works.\n\nSimilarly, let's check another cubic polynomial, say \\( P(x) = x^3 + x \\). Then, can we find \\( x_1, x_2, x_3 \\) such that \\( P(x_1) + P(x_2) = P(x_3) \\)? That would require:\n\n\\( (x_1^3 + x_1) + (x_2^3 + x_2) = x_3^3 + x_3 \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( x_1^3 + x_2^3 + x_1 + x_2 = x_3^3 + x_3 \\)\n\nWe might look for symmetric solutions. Let's try \\( x_1 = a \\), \\( x_2 = -a \\):\n\nThen:\n\n\\( a^3 + (-a)^3 + a + (-a) = 0 + 0 = 0 \\)\n\nSo we need \\( x_3 \\) such that \\( x_3^3 + x_3 = 0 \\). Which gives \\( x_3(x_3^2 + 1) = 0 \\). So solutions are \\( x_3 = 0 \\), or \\( x_3^2 = -1 \\), but the latter has no integer solutions. Therefore, \\( x_3 = 0 \\). Then, 0 is distinct from \\( a \\) and \\( -a \\) as long as \\( a \\neq 0 \\). Therefore, this works. So for \\( P(x) = x^3 + x \\), even though it's cubic, \\( k = 2 \\) works.\n\nTherefore, perhaps even for cubic polynomials, \\( k = 2 \\) can be used in many cases. Wait, but maybe not always?\n\nSuppose a cubic polynomial is \\( P(x) = x^3 + c x \\), for some constant \\( c \\). Then, is there always a solution with \\( k = 2 \\)?\n\nSuppose we take \\( x_1 = a \\), \\( x_2 = -a \\). Then:\n\n\\( P(a) + P(-a) = (a^3 + c a) + (-a^3 - c a) = 0 = P(x_3) \\). Therefore, \\( x_3 = 0 \\) works as \\( P(0) = 0 \\). Therefore, for any such \\( P(x) = x^3 + c x \\), this works. Therefore, even if \\( c \\) is chosen such that \\( P(x) = x^3 + c x \\), taking \\( x_1 = a \\), \\( x_2 = -a \\), and \\( x_3 = 0 \\) gives a solution. Therefore, \\( k = 2 \\) works.\n\nAlternatively, even if the cubic is irreducible or not. Suppose a cubic that's not of the form \\( x^3 + c x \\). For example, \\( P(x) = x^3 + x + 1 \\). Then:\n\nIf we take \\( x_1 = a \\), \\( x_2 = -a \\), then \\( P(a) + P(-a) = (a^3 + a + 1) + (-a^3 -a + 1) = 2 \\). Therefore, we need \\( x_3 \\) such that \\( P(x_3) = 2 \\). So solve \\( x_3^3 + x_3 + 1 = 2 \\), which is \\( x_3^3 + x_3 - 1 = 0 \\). Let's check integer solutions. Plug in x = 0: 0 + 0 -1 = -1 ≠ 0. x = 1: 1 + 1 -1 = 1 ≠ 0. x = -1: -1 -1 -1 = -3 ≠ 0. So no integer solutions. Therefore, this approach fails. However, maybe there exists another set \\( x_1, x_2, x_3 \\) such that the sum equals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe take different \\( x_1, x_2 \\). For example, take \\( x_1 = 1 \\), \\( x_2 = 0 \\). Then \\( P(1) + P(0) = (1 + 1 + 1) + (0 + 0 + 1) = 3 + 1 = 4 \\). Then \\( x_3 \\) must satisfy \\( P(x_3) = 4 \\), i.e., \\( x_3^3 + x_3 + 1 = 4 \\) → \\( x_3^3 + x_3 - 3 = 0 \\). Check x = 1: 1 + 1 - 3 = -1. x = 2: 8 + 2 -3 =7 ≠0. x = -1: -1 -1 -3 = -5 ≠0. So no integer solution. Alternatively, take \\( x_1 = 2 \\), \\( x_2 = 0 \\). Then \\( P(2) + P(0) = (8 + 2 +1) + 1 = 12. So need x_3 such that \\( x_3^3 + x_3 + 1 =12 \\) → \\( x_3^3 + x_3 =11 \\). x=2: 8 +2=10≠11. x=3:27 +3=30≠11. x=1:1 +1=2≠11. No solution. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, take \\( x_1 = 1 \\), \\( x_2 = 1 \\). But they need to be distinct. So not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, take \\( x_1 =1 \\), \\( x_2 =2 \\). Then \\( P(1) + P(2) = 3 + 12 =15 \\). Then \\( x_3^3 + x_3 +1 =15 \\) → \\( x_3^3 + x_3 =14 \\). Testing x=2:8 +2=10. x=3:27 +3=30. x= -2: -8 -2=-10. No solution. So maybe this cubic polynomial is problematic.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake. The problem states \"for every monic polynomial\", so if even a single monic polynomial of degree at most 3 doesn't satisfy the condition, then \\( n = 3 \\) is invalid. But the example above shows that \\( P(x) = x^3 + x + 1 \\) cannot have such \\( x_1, x_2, x_3 \\) with \\( k = 2 \\). However, maybe with \\( k = 3 \\), we can have \\( 4 \\) integers (x1, x2, x3, x4). So perhaps for this cubic, even \\( k = 3 \\) is possible?\n\nSo, let's check with \\( k = 3 \\). So need 4 distinct integers such that \\( P(x1) + P(x2) + P(x3) = P(x4) \\). For \\( P(x) = x^3 + x + 1 \\), we need:\n\n\\( x1^3 +x1 +1 +x2^3 +x2 +1 +x3^3 +x3 +1 = x4^3 +x4 +1 \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( x1^3 + x2^3 + x3^3 + x1 + x2 + x3 + 3 = x4^3 +x4 +1 \\)\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\( x1^3 + x2^3 + x3^3 + x1 + x2 + x3 + 2 = x4^3 +x4 \\)\n\nWe need to find four distinct integers x1, x2, x3, x4 such that the above equation holds.\n\nThis seems quite involved. Let's try to find such integers. Let's consider small integers.\n\nSuppose we take x1 = 0, x2 = 1, x3 = -1. Then:\n\nLeft side: \\( 0 +1 + (-1) +0 +1 + (-1) +2 = 0 +0 +0 +2 =2 \\)\n\nTherefore, we need \\( x4^3 +x4 = 2 \\). Check x4: x=1:1 +1=2. So x4=1. However, x4=1 is equal to x2=1. So not distinct. Therefore, invalid.\n\nAlternatively, take x1=2, x2=-1, x3=-1. Then x3=-1 is duplicate. Not allowed. Maybe x1=2, x2=-1, x3=0.\n\nLeft side:8 + (-1) +0 +2 + (-1) +0 +2= 8 -1 +0 +2 -1 +0 +2=8 + (-1 +2 -1) +2=8 +0 +2=10. Therefore, need x4^3 +x4=10.\n\nCheck x=2:8 +2=10. So x4=2, but x4=2 is equal to x1=2. Not distinct. Alternatively, x= -2: -8 + (-2)= -10≠10. x=1:1 +1=2≠10. x=3:27 +3=30≠10. So no solution here.\n\nAlternatively, take x1=1, x2=1, x3=1. Not distinct. No.\n\nAlternatively, take x1=3, x2=-2, x3=-2. Then x3=-2 duplicate. Not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, x1=3, x2=-3, x3=1.\n\nLeft side:27 + (-3) +1 +3 + (-3) +1 +2=27 -3 +1 +3 -3 +1 +2=27 + (-3 +3) + (-3 +1) +1 +2=27 +0 + (-2) +1 +2=27 +1=28. Therefore, need x4^3 +x4=28.\n\nCheck x=3:27 +3=30≠28. x=2:8 +2=10≠28. x=4:64 +4=68≠28. x= -3:-27 + (-3)=-30≠28. No solution.\n\nAlternatively, take x1=1, x2=2, x3=3.\n\nLeft side:1 +8 +27 +1 +2 +3 +2=1 +8 +27 +1 +2 +3 +2=42. So need x4^3 +x4=42.\n\nCheck x=3:27 +3=30. x=4:64 +4=68. x= -4:-64 + (-4)=-68≠42. x= -3:-27 + (-3)=-30≠42. So no solution.\n\nAlternatively, take x1= -1, x2=0, x3=1.\n\nLeft side: (-1)^3 + (-1) +1 +0 +0 +1 +2=(-1) + (-1) +1 +0 +0 +1 +2=2. Need x4=1 as before, but duplicate. So no.\n\nAlternatively, take x1= -2, x2=3, x3= -1.\n\nLeft side: (-8) +3 + (-1) + (-2) +3 + (-1) +2= -8 +3 -1 -2 +3 -1 +2= (-8 -2 -1",

        "content": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking for all positive integers \\( n \\) such that for every monic polynomial \\( P \\) of degree at most \\( n \\) with integer coefficients, there exists a positive integer \\( k \\leq n \\) and \\( k+1 \\) distinct integers \\( x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_{k+1} \\) satisfying the equation:\n\n\\[\nP(x_1) + P(x_2) + \\cdots + P(x_k) = P(x_{k+1})\n\\]\n\nFirst, let's parse the problem statement to make sure I understand it correctly. We need to find all positive integers \\( n \\) where the condition holds for every monic polynomial \\( P \\) of degree at most \\( n \\) with integer coefficients. The key points are:\n\n1. \\( P \\) is monic with integer coefficients.\n2. \\( k \\leq n \\).\n3. There must exist \\( k+1 \\) distinct integers \\( x_1, \\ldots, x_{k+1} \\) such that the sum of \\( P \\) evaluated at the first \\( k \\) integers equals \\( P \\) evaluated at the last one.\n\nThe problem is asking for all such \\( n \\). So, first, let's consider small values of \\( n \\) and see if the condition holds or fails. That might help us spot a pattern or come up with a conjecture.\n\n**Case n = 1:**\n\nFor \\( n = 1 \\), we need to check if every monic linear polynomial (degree 1) with integer coefficients satisfies the condition. Let \\( P(x) = x + c \\), where \\( c \\) is an integer.\n\nWe need to find \\( k \\leq 1 \\), so \\( k = 1 \\). Then, we need 2 distinct integers \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\) such that \\( P(x_1) = P(x_2) \\). However, since \\( P \\) is linear and strictly increasing (as the coefficient of \\( x \\) is 1, which is positive), \\( P(x_1) = P(x_2) \\) implies \\( x_1 = x_2 \\), which contradicts the requirement that they are distinct. Therefore, for \\( n = 1 \\), the condition fails. So \\( n = 1 \\) is not a solution.\n\nWait, but hold on. The problem says \"for every monic polynomial of degree at most \\( n \\)\". So for \\( n = 1 \\), the polynomials we have to consider are constants and linear polynomials. But since \\( k \\leq 1 \\), and for linear polynomials, we can't find two distinct integers with the same \\( P(x) \\). However, maybe the problem is considering degree at most \\( n \\), so including degree 0. For \\( P \\) being a constant polynomial, say \\( P(x) = c \\). Then, for any \\( k \\leq 1 \\), say \\( k = 1 \\), we need \\( 1 + 1 = 2 \\) distinct integers where \\( P(x_1) = P(x_2) \\). But since \\( P \\) is constant, \\( P(x_1) = P(x_2) \\) for any \\( x_1, x_2 \\), so that's trivially true. Therefore, for constant polynomials, \\( k = 1 \\) works, but for linear polynomials, \\( k = 1 \\) doesn't work. However, since the problem states \"for every monic polynomial of degree at most \\( n \\)\", and constant polynomials are allowed, but we cannot guarantee that all linear polynomials (or constant polynomials) satisfy the condition. Wait, but the problem is not saying \"for all polynomials\" but \"for every monic polynomial\". So both constant and linear are monic (if constant, then the degree is 0, which is allowed since n=1, and \"monic\" for a degree 0 polynomial is just a constant polynomial). So if a monic polynomial can have degree 0 or 1, but when it's degree 1, we cannot find such \\( x_1, x_2 \\). Therefore, \\( n = 1 \\) fails because there exists a monic polynomial (of degree 1) where the condition is not met. Therefore, \\( n = 1 \\) is not a solution.\n\n**Case n = 2:**\n\nNow, for \\( n = 2 \\), we need to check if every monic polynomial of degree at most 2 (i.e., quadratic) satisfies the condition. For \\( k \\leq 2 \\), so \\( k = 1 \\) or \\( k = 2 \\). We need to check if for every monic quadratic polynomial \\( P \\) with integer coefficients, there exists \\( k \\leq 2 \\) and \\( k + 1 \\) distinct integers such that the sum of \\( k \\) evaluations equals the \\( (k+1)\\)-th evaluation.\n\nFirst, let's check for \\( k = 1 \\). For \\( k = 1 \\), we need 2 distinct integers \\( x_1, x_2 \\) such that \\( P(x_1) = P(x_2) \\). Since \\( P \\) is a quadratic polynomial, it is a parabola. If it's not symmetric (i.e., not a constant), it is symmetric about its vertex. Therefore, for any quadratic polynomial, there exists a pair of distinct integers symmetric about the vertex's x-coordinate that map to the same value. However, since we need integers, unless the vertex is at a half-integer, there might be such pairs. But even if the vertex is not at a half-integer, we can still have integer points symmetric around the vertex. Wait, let's think.\n\nSuppose the vertex of the quadratic \\( P(x) = x^2 + bx + c \\) is at \\( x = -b/2 \\). If \\( b \\) is even, then the vertex is at an integer, and then the points \\( x \\) and \\( -x - b \\) will be symmetric around the vertex and will have the same value. But if \\( b \\) is odd, then the vertex is at a half-integer. However, even in that case, we can still find integers \\( x \\) such that \\( x \\) and \\( -x - b \\) are distinct integers. Wait, but \\( x \\) and \\( -x - b \\) are distinct unless \\( 2x + b = 0 \\), which would mean \\( x = -b/2 \\). But if \\( b \\) is odd, then \\( x \\) is not an integer. So in that case, the symmetric points around the vertex are non-integer, but we need integer points. Therefore, even if the vertex is at a half-integer, there might not be two integer points equidistant from the vertex. For example, take \\( P(x) = x^2 + x \\). The vertex is at \\( x = -1/2 \\). Then, is there an integer \\( x \\) such that \\( P(x) = P(-1 - x) \\)? Let's check:\n\nCompute \\( P(-1 - x) = (-1 - x)^2 + (-1 - x) = (1 + 2x + x^2) -1 -x = x^2 + x = P(x) \\). So \\( P(-1 - x) = P(x) \\). Therefore, even when the vertex is at a half-integer, if \\( x \\) is integer, then \\( P(-1 - x) = P(x) \\). Therefore, for any quadratic \\( P(x) = x^2 + bx + c \\), we can take \\( x \\) and \\( -b -x \\) as the two integers such that \\( P(x) = P(-b -x) \\). Therefore, even when \\( b \\) is odd, there exist two integers \\( x \\) and \\( -b -x \\) (which are distinct as long as \\( x \\) is not fixed by the symmetry). Since \\( x \\) can be chosen such that \\( x \\neq (-b -x) \\), which implies \\( 2x + b \\neq 0 \\), so as long as \\( x \\) is not \\( -b/2 \\), but since \\( x \\) must be an integer, if \\( b \\) is even, then \\( x \\) can be any integer, and \\( -b -x \\) is distinct from \\( x \\). If \\( b \\) is odd, then \\( x \\) is an integer, and \\( -b -x \\) is also an integer, and \\( x \\neq -b -x \\) since \\( 2x + b = 0 \\) would require \\( x = -b/2 \\), which is not an integer if \\( b \\) is odd. Therefore, for any quadratic polynomial, \\( k = 1 \\) suffices, and we can always find such a pair.\n\nTherefore, for \\( n = 2 \\), even though some polynomials may require \\( k = 2 \\), but in fact, for quadratic polynomials, \\( k = 1 \\) works because we can always find two integers \\( x_1, x_2 \\) such that \\( P(x_1) = P(x_2) \\). Therefore, \\( n = 2 \\) works. Wait, but wait. Let's check with a specific example. Take \\( P(x) = x^2 \\). Then \\( P(x) = P(-x) \\), so \\( x_1 = 1 \\), \\( x_2 = -1 \\), so indeed, \\( P(1) = P(-1) \\). Similarly, for \\( P(x) = x^2 + x \\), as I checked before, choosing \\( x = 0 \\), then \\( P(0) = 0 \\), \\( P(-1 -0) = P(-1) = (-1)^2 + (-1) = 1 - 1 = 0 \\), so yes, that works. So even when the polynomial isn't even, we can still find such a pair. Therefore, \\( k = 1 \\) works for all quadratics. So maybe \\( n = 2 \\) is acceptable.\n\nBut wait, hold on. The problem states \"for every monic polynomial of degree at most \\( n \\)\". So for \\( n = 2 \\), polynomials can be linear or constant. But we saw that linear polynomials can't have \\( k = 1 \\) since they are injective. However, but quadratic polynomials can use \\( k = 1 \\), but if there are linear polynomials, does that affect the condition?\n\nWait, the problem states: \"for every monic polynomial \\( P \\) of degree at most \\( n \\) with integer coefficients\". So, if \\( n = 2 \\), we need the condition to hold for all such polynomials, including linear ones. However, linear polynomials, as we saw earlier, require \\( k = 1 \\), which doesn't work because \\( x_1 = x_2 \\) is needed, but they need to be distinct. Therefore, for linear polynomials, the condition fails. But the problem says \"for every monic polynomial of degree at most \\( n \\)\"... So even if \\( n = 2 \\), there are polynomials (the linear ones) where the condition fails. Therefore, \\( n = 2 \\) doesn't work.\n\nWait, this seems contradictory. Wait, no. Wait, when \\( n = 2 \\), the problem is to satisfy that condition for every monic polynomial of degree at most 2. But some of those polynomials are linear, and for them, \\( k = 1 \\) would require two distinct integers with the same polynomial value, which is impossible because linear polynomials are injective. Therefore, for \\( n = 2 \\), since there exist monic polynomials (degree 1) where the condition fails, \\( n = 2 \\) is not a solution. Wait, but earlier reasoning suggested that quadratics can use \\( k = 1 \\), but linear polynomials cannot. But since the problem requires that the condition holds for all polynomials of degree at most \\( n \\), even if one polynomial fails, then \\( n \\) is invalid. Therefore, \\( n = 2 \\) is invalid because of the linear polynomials. So then, maybe the only possible \\( n \\) is when \\( n \\geq 2 \\) but including higher degrees? Wait, but let's think again.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-examine the problem statement: \"Determine all positive integers \\( n \\) satisfying the following condition: for every monic polynomial \\( P \\) of degree at most \\( n \\) with integer coefficients, there exists a positive integer \\( k \\leq n \\), and \\( k+1 \\) distinct integers \\( x_1, \\ldots, x_{k+1} \\) such that \\( P(x_1) + \\cdots + P(x_k) = P(x_{k+1}) \\).\"\n\nSo for each \\( P \\), you can choose \\( k \\leq n \\). So for each \\( P \\), if \\( k = 1 \\) is sufficient, then it's okay. But for some polynomials, \\( k = 1 \\) may not work, but \\( k = 2 \\) might. So perhaps even though some polynomials (like linear) can't be handled with \\( k = 1 \\), maybe they can be handled with a larger \\( k \\). Therefore, perhaps \\( n = 2 \\) works because even though linear polynomials need \\( k = 1 \\), which is impossible, maybe they can use \\( k = 2 \\).\n\nWait, so for a linear polynomial \\( P(x) = x + c \\), we need \\( k \\leq 2 \\). So for \\( k = 1 \\), impossible as before, but for \\( k = 2 \\), we need 3 distinct integers such that \\( P(x_1) + P(x_2) = P(x_3) \\).\n\nGiven that \\( P(x) = x + c \\), then:\n\n\\( (x_1 + c) + (x_2 + c) = x_3 + c \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( x_1 + x_2 + 2c = x_3 + c \\)\n\n\\( x_1 + x_2 + c = x_3 \\)\n\nTherefore, we need to find three distinct integers \\( x_1, x_2, x_3 \\) such that \\( x_3 = x_1 + x_2 + c \\).\n\nSince \\( c \\) is an integer (because the polynomial has integer coefficients), and \\( x_1, x_2, x_3 \\) are distinct integers. So is this possible?\n\nFor example, let's take \\( c = 0 \\), so \\( P(x) = x \\). Then we need \\( x_3 = x_1 + x_2 \\). So we need three distinct integers where one is the sum of the other two. For example, take \\( x_1 = 1 \\), \\( x_2 = 2 \\), then \\( x_3 = 3 \\). So yes, that works. Similarly, for any linear polynomial \\( P(x) = x + c \\), can we find such integers?\n\nLet me choose \\( x_1 = 0 \\), \\( x_2 = 1 \\). Then \\( x_3 = 0 + 1 + c = 1 + c \\). So we need \\( x_3 \\) to be distinct from \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\). So as long as \\( 1 + c \\) is not equal to 0 or 1. But \\( c \\) is an integer. If \\( c = 0 \\), then \\( x_3 = 1 \\), which is equal to \\( x_2 \\), which is not allowed. If \\( c = -1 \\), then \\( x_3 = 0 \\), equal to \\( x_1 \\). If \\( c = 1 \\), \\( x_3 = 2 \\), which is distinct from \\( x_1 = 0 \\), \\( x_2 = 1 \\). So in that case, it works. However, if \\( c = -2 \\), then \\( x_3 = -1 \\), which is distinct from 0 and 1. So perhaps even if \\( c = 0 \\), if I choose different \\( x_1, x_2 \\). For \\( c = 0 \\), \\( x_3 = x_1 + x_2 \\). So if I choose \\( x_1 = 1 \\), \\( x_2 = 2 \\), then \\( x_3 = 3 \\). That's distinct. So even if \\( c = 0 \\), we can choose \\( x_1 = 1 \\), \\( x_2 = 2 \\), giving \\( x_3 = 3 \\). So perhaps, for linear polynomials, even though \\( k = 1 \\) is impossible, \\( k = 2 \\) works. Therefore, maybe \\( n = 2 \\) is acceptable.\n\nWait, but wait. Let's formalize this. For a linear polynomial \\( P(x) = x + c \\), we need to find three distinct integers \\( x_1, x_2, x_3 \\) such that \\( x_3 = x_1 + x_2 + c \\). Is this always possible?\n\nSuppose we fix \\( x_1 = t \\) and \\( x_2 = t + 1 \\). Then \\( x_3 = t + (t + 1) + c = 2t + 1 + c \\). We need to ensure that \\( x_3 \\) is distinct from \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\). So \\( 2t + 1 + c \\neq t \\) and \\( 2t + 1 + c \\neq t + 1 \\). The first inequality: \\( 2t + 1 + c \\neq t \\) implies \\( t + 1 + c \\neq 0 \\), so \\( t \\neq -c - 1 \\). The second inequality: \\( 2t + 1 + c \\neq t + 1 \\) implies \\( t + c \\neq 0 \\), so \\( t \\neq -c \\).\n\nSo as long as we can choose \\( t \\) such that \\( t \\neq -c -1 \\) and \\( t \\neq -c \\), then \\( x_3 \\) will be distinct from \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\). Since integers are infinite, there are infinitely many \\( t \\) to choose from, so we can always find such a \\( t \\). For example, choose \\( t = 0 \\). Then \\( x_3 = 0 + 1 + c = 1 + c \\). If \\( c = 0 \\), then \\( x_3 = 1 \\), which is equal to \\( x_2 = 1 \\). So that's a problem. But if \\( c \\neq 0 \\), \\( x_3 = 1 + c \\) which is distinct from \\( x_1 = 0 \\) and \\( x_2 = 1 \\). Wait, but if \\( c = 0 \\), then \\( x_3 = 1 \\), which is equal to \\( x_2 = 1 \\). Therefore, if \\( c = 0 \\), this choice fails. So in that case, we need to choose a different \\( t \\). For example, take \\( t = 2 \\). Then \\( x_3 = 2 + 3 + c = 5 + c \\). For \\( c = 0 \\), \\( x_3 = 5 \\), which is distinct from 0, 1, 2. So perhaps even if \\( c = 0 \\), we can choose a different \\( t \\). Let's see.\n\nSo in the case \\( c = 0 \\), \\( x_1 = 2 \\), \\( x_2 = 3 \\), then \\( x_3 = 2 + 3 + 0 = 5 \\). So \\( x_3 = 5 \\), which is distinct from 2 and 3. So yes, even for \\( c = 0 \\), we can find such \\( t \\).\n\nTherefore, even for linear polynomials, even though \\( k = 1 \\) fails, \\( k = 2 \\) works. Therefore, for \\( n = 2 \\), since all monic polynomials of degree at most 2 (quadratic and linear) can be handled with \\( k = 2 \\), then \\( n = 2 \\) is acceptable.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose the linear polynomial is \\( P(x) = x + c \\). Then, for any such polynomial, the equation \\( P(x_1) + P(x_2) = P(x_3) \\) reduces to \\( x_1 + x_2 + 2c = x_3 + c \\), so \\( x_3 = x_1 + x_2 + c \\). We need three distinct integers \\( x_1, x_2, x_3 \\). As we saw, choosing \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\) sufficiently apart can ensure that \\( x_3 \\) is distinct from both. So, as long as \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\) are chosen such that \\( x_3 \\) isn't equal to either. Since there are infinitely many integers, we can always find such \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\). Therefore, for linear polynomials, even though \\( k = 1 \\) fails, \\( k = 2 \\) works. Hence, \\( n = 2 \\) is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, maybe \\( n = 2 \\) works. Now, what about \\( n = 3 \\)? Let's check.\n\n**Case n = 3:**\n\nFor \\( n = 3 \\), we need to check if every monic polynomial of degree at most 3 (cubic, quadratic, linear, or constant) can have \\( k \\leq 3 \\) such that \\( k+1 \\) distinct integers \\( x_1, \\ldots, x_{k+1} \\) satisfy the equation.\n\nSimilarly, for quadratic and cubic polynomials, even if \\( k = 1 \\) works (for quadratics as they are not injective), but for cubics, we need to check if \\( k = 1 \\) is always possible.\n\nWait, a cubic polynomial can be injective or not. Wait, over integers, injectivity of polynomials is different. In fact, a polynomial of odd degree is not injective over integers because they tend to negative and positive infinity. Wait, actually, for integer polynomials, being injective is tricky. For example, \\( x^3 \\) is injective over integers because if \\( x_1^3 = x_2^3 \\), then \\( x_1 = x_2 \\). So in that case, \\( P(x) = x^3 \\) is injective over integers. So in this case, \\( k = 1 \\) would require two distinct integers with the same value, which is impossible for injective functions. Therefore, for \\( P(x) = x^3 \\), \\( k = 1 \\) is impossible. Then, can we use \\( k = 2 \\) or \\( k = 3 \\)?\n\nSo for \\( P(x) = x^3 \\), we need \\( k \\leq 3 \\), so \\( k = 2 \\) or \\( k = 3 \\).\n\nFirst, let's check \\( k = 2 \\). Then, we need 3 distinct integers \\( x_1, x_2, x_3 \\) such that \\( P(x_1) + P(x_2) = P(x_3) \\). So:\n\n\\( x_1^3 + x_2^3 = x_3^3 \\)\n\nBut by Fermat's Last Theorem for the equation \\( a^3 + b^3 = c^3 \\), there are no positive integers \\( a, b, c \\) satisfying this. However, in our case, the integers can be negative. So maybe there are solutions with negative integers?\n\nWait, suppose \\( x_1 = 1 \\), \\( x_2 = -1 \\). Then \\( 1^3 + (-1)^3 = 0 = x_3^3 \\), so \\( x_3 = 0 \\). Therefore, \\( x_3 = 0 \\), which is distinct from 1 and -1. Therefore, \\( x_1 = 1 \\), \\( x_2 = -1 \\), \\( x_3 = 0 \\) gives \\( 1^3 + (-1)^3 = 0^3 \\), which works. Therefore, for the cubic \\( P(x) = x^3 \\), with \\( k = 2 \\), there exists a solution. So \\( k = 2 \\) works here.\n\nAlternatively, even if we take \\( x_1 = a \\), \\( x_2 = -a \\), then \\( P(x_1) + P(x_2) = a^3 + (-a)^3 = 0 = P(0) \\). So that's a valid solution as long as 0 is distinct from \\( a \\) and \\( -a \\). Since \\( a \\neq 0 \\), then \\( a \\), \\( -a \\), and 0 are distinct. Therefore, for any non-zero integer \\( a \\), choosing \\( x_1 = a \\), \\( x_2 = -a \\), \\( x_3 = 0 \\) satisfies the condition. Therefore, for \\( P(x) = x^3 \\), \\( k = 2 \\) works. Therefore, even though \\( k = 1 \\) fails, \\( k = 2 \\) works.\n\nSimilarly, let's check another cubic polynomial, say \\( P(x) = x^3 + x \\). Then, can we find \\( x_1, x_2, x_3 \\) such that \\( P(x_1) + P(x_2) = P(x_3) \\)? That would require:\n\n\\( (x_1^3 + x_1) + (x_2^3 + x_2) = x_3^3 + x_3 \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( x_1^3 + x_2^3 + x_1 + x_2 = x_3^3 + x_3 \\)\n\nWe might look for symmetric solutions. Let's try \\( x_1 = a \\), \\( x_2 = -a \\):\n\nThen:\n\n\\( a^3 + (-a)^3 + a + (-a) = 0 + 0 = 0 \\)\n\nSo we need \\( x_3 \\) such that \\( x_3^3 + x_3 = 0 \\). Which gives \\( x_3(x_3^2 + 1) = 0 \\). So solutions are \\( x_3 = 0 \\), or \\( x_3^2 = -1 \\), but the latter has no integer solutions. Therefore, \\( x_3 = 0 \\). Then, 0 is distinct from \\( a \\) and \\( -a \\) as long as \\( a \\neq 0 \\). Therefore, this works. So for \\( P(x) = x^3 + x \\), even though it's cubic, \\( k = 2 \\) works.\n\nTherefore, perhaps even for cubic polynomials, \\( k = 2 \\) can be used in many cases. Wait, but maybe not always?\n\nSuppose a cubic polynomial is \\( P(x) = x^3 + c x \\), for some constant \\( c \\). Then, is there always a solution with \\( k = 2 \\)?\n\nSuppose we take \\( x_1 = a \\), \\( x_2 = -a \\). Then:\n\n\\( P(a) + P(-a) = (a^3 + c a) + (-a^3 - c a) = 0 = P(x_3) \\). Therefore, \\( x_3 = 0 \\) works as \\( P(0) = 0 \\). Therefore, for any such \\( P(x) = x^3 + c x \\), this works. Therefore, even if \\( c \\) is chosen such that \\( P(x) = x^3 + c x \\), taking \\( x_1 = a \\), \\( x_2 = -a \\), and \\( x_3 = 0 \\) gives a solution. Therefore, \\( k = 2 \\) works.\n\nAlternatively, even if the cubic is irreducible or not. Suppose a cubic that's not of the form \\( x^3 + c x \\). For example, \\( P(x) = x^3 + x + 1 \\). Then:\n\nIf we take \\( x_1 = a \\), \\( x_2 = -a \\), then \\( P(a) + P(-a) = (a^3 + a + 1) + (-a^3 -a + 1) = 2 \\). Therefore, we need \\( x_3 \\) such that \\( P(x_3) = 2 \\). So solve \\( x_3^3 + x_3 + 1 = 2 \\), which is \\( x_3^3 + x_3 - 1 = 0 \\). Let's check integer solutions. Plug in x = 0: 0 + 0 -1 = -1 ≠ 0. x = 1: 1 + 1 -1 = 1 ≠ 0. x = -1: -1 -1 -1 = -3 ≠ 0. So no integer solutions. Therefore, this approach fails. However, maybe there exists another set \\( x_1, x_2, x_3 \\) such that the sum equals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe take different \\( x_1, x_2 \\). For example, take \\( x_1 = 1 \\), \\( x_2 = 0 \\). Then \\( P(1) + P(0) = (1 + 1 + 1) + (0 + 0 + 1) = 3 + 1 = 4 \\). Then \\( x_3 \\) must satisfy \\( P(x_3) = 4 \\), i.e., \\( x_3^3 + x_3 + 1 = 4 \\) → \\( x_3^3 + x_3 - 3 = 0 \\). Check x = 1: 1 + 1 - 3 = -1. x = 2: 8 + 2 -3 =7 ≠0. x = -1: -1 -1 -3 = -5 ≠0. So no integer solution. Alternatively, take \\( x_1 = 2 \\), \\( x_2 = 0 \\). Then \\( P(2) + P(0) = (8 + 2 +1) + 1 = 12. So need x_3 such that \\( x_3^3 + x_3 + 1 =12 \\) → \\( x_3^3 + x_3 =11 \\). x=2: 8 +2=10≠11. x=3:27 +3=30≠11. x=1:1 +1=2≠11. No solution. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, take \\( x_1 = 1 \\), \\( x_2 = 1 \\). But they need to be distinct. So not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, take \\( x_1 =1 \\), \\( x_2 =2 \\). Then \\( P(1) + P(2) = 3 + 12 =15 \\). Then \\( x_3^3 + x_3 +1 =15 \\) → \\( x_3^3 + x_3 =14 \\). Testing x=2:8 +2=10. x=3:27 +3=30. x= -2: -8 -2=-10. No solution. So maybe this cubic polynomial is problematic.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake. The problem states \"for every monic polynomial\", so if even a single monic polynomial of degree at most 3 doesn't satisfy the condition, then \\( n = 3 \\) is invalid. But the example above shows that \\( P(x) = x^3 + x + 1 \\) cannot have such \\( x_1, x_2, x_3 \\) with \\( k = 2 \\). However, maybe with \\( k = 3 \\), we can have \\( 4 \\) integers (x1, x2, x3, x4). So perhaps for this cubic, even \\( k = 3 \\) is possible?\n\nSo, let's check with \\( k = 3 \\). So need 4 distinct integers such that \\( P(x1) + P(x2) + P(x3) = P(x4) \\). For \\( P(x) = x^3 + x + 1 \\), we need:\n\n\\( x1^3 +x1 +1 +x2^3 +x2 +1 +x3^3 +x3 +1 = x4^3 +x4 +1 \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( x1^3 + x2^3 + x3^3 + x1 + x2 + x3 + 3 = x4^3 +x4 +1 \\)\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\( x1^3 + x2^3 + x3^3 + x1 + x2 + x3 + 2 = x4^3 +x4 \\)\n\nWe need to find four distinct integers x1, x2, x3, x4 such that the above equation holds.\n\nThis seems quite involved. Let's try to find such integers. Let's consider small integers.\n\nSuppose we take x1 = 0, x2 = 1, x3 = -1. Then:\n\nLeft side: \\( 0 +1 + (-1) +0 +1 + (-1) +2 = 0 +0 +0 +2 =2 \\)\n\nTherefore, we need \\( x4^3 +x4 = 2 \\). Check x4: x=1:1 +1=2. So x4=1. However, x4=1 is equal to x2=1. So not distinct. Therefore, invalid.\n\nAlternatively, take x1=2, x2=-1, x3=-1. Then x3=-1 is duplicate. Not allowed. Maybe x1=2, x2=-1, x3=0.\n\nLeft side:8 + (-1) +0 +2 + (-1) +0 +2= 8 -1 +0 +2 -1 +0 +2=8 + (-1 +2 -1) +2=8 +0 +2=10. Therefore, need x4^3 +x4=10.\n\nCheck x=2:8 +2=10. So x4=2, but x4=2 is equal to x1=2. Not distinct. Alternatively, x= -2: -8 + (-2)= -10≠10. x=1:1 +1=2≠10. x=3:27 +3=30≠10. So no solution here.\n\nAlternatively, take x1=1, x2=1, x3=1. Not distinct. No.\n\nAlternatively, take x1=3, x2=-2, x3=-2. Then x3=-2 duplicate. Not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, x1=3, x2=-3, x3=1.\n\nLeft side:27 + (-3) +1 +3 + (-3) +1 +2=27 -3 +1 +3 -3 +1 +2=27 + (-3 +3) + (-3 +1) +1 +2=27 +0 + (-2) +1 +2=27 +1=28. Therefore, need x4^3 +x4=28.\n\nCheck x=3:27 +3=30≠28. x=2:8 +2=10≠28. x=4:64 +4=68≠28. x= -3:-27 + (-3)=-30≠28. No solution.\n\nAlternatively, take x1=1, x2=2, x3=3.\n\nLeft side:1 +8 +27 +1 +2 +3 +2=1 +8 +27 +1 +2 +3 +2=42. So need x4^3 +x4=42.\n\nCheck x=3:27 +3=30. x=4:64 +4=68. x= -4:-64 + (-4)=-68≠42. x= -3:-27 + (-3)=-30≠42. So no solution.\n\nAlternatively, take x1= -1, x2=0, x3=1.\n\nLeft side: (-1)^3 + (-1) +1 +0 +0 +1 +2=(-1) + (-1) +1 +0 +0 +1 +2=2. Need x4=1 as before, but duplicate. So no.\n\nAlternatively, take x1= -2, x2=3, x3= -1.\n\nLeft side: (-8) +3 + (-1) + (-2) +3 + (-1) +2= -8 +3 -1 -2 +3 -1 +2= (-8 -2 -1",

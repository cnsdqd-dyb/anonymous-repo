The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.Q: Which one of the following lists the compositions in an order in which they could be performed during the concert, from first through eighth?

Here, T is fourth, F is seventh. So T is before F (satisfies condition 1).\n- Condition 2: At least two between F and R. F is 7, R is 4. The compositions between them are 5,6 (S and R is 4, so between 4 and 7: 5,6. That's two compositions (S and T). So two in between.\u6ee1\u8db3\u6761\u4ef62.\n- Condition 3: O is fifth. Yes, O is fifth.\u6ee1\u8db3\u6761\u4ef63.\n- Condition4: Eighth is H. Yes, eighth is H.\u6ee1\u8db3\u6761\u4ef64.\n- Condition5: P is before S. P is second, S is third. Yes.\u6ee1\u8db3\u6761\u4ef65.\n- Condition6: At least one between O and S. O is fifth, S is third. So between 3 and 5: positions 4 is T. So one composition (T) between O and S. Satisfies condition6.\n\n**Option A seems to satisfy all conditions.**\n\nBut let me check the other options to be sure.\n\n**Option B: O, T, P, F, S, H, R, L**\n\n- Condition1: T before F. T is second, F is fourth. Not immediately before. So condition1 violated. So B is invalid.\n\n**Option C: P, T, F, S, L, R, O, H**\n\n- Condition1: R is sixth, T is third. R is not before F. F is third, R is sixth. So not immediately after R. Also, T is second, F is third. Not immediately before. So condition1 fails. C is invalid.\n\n**Option D: P, T, F, S, O, R, L, H**\n\n- Condition1: R is sixth, F is third. R is not before F. Also, T is second, F is third. Not immediately before. So condition1 fails. D is invalid.\n\n**Option E: T, F, P, R, O, L, S, H**\n\n- Condition1: T is first, F is second. So immediately before. Satisfies condition1.\n- Condition2: F is second, R is fourth. Compositions between F(2) and R(4) is none. Only one composition (P). So less than two. Violates condition2.

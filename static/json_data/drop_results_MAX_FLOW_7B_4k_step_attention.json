                "problem": "Passage:  Hoping to rebound from their loss to the Patriots, the Raiders stayed at home for a Week 16 duel with the Houston Texans.  Oakland would get the early lead in the first quarter as quarterback JaMarcus Russell completed a 20-yard touchdown pass to rookie wide receiver Chaz Schilens.  The Texans would respond with fullback Vonta Leach getting a 1-yard touchdown run, yet the Raiders would answer with kicker Sebastian Janikowski getting a 33-yard and a 30-yard field goal.  Houston would tie the game in the second quarter with kicker Kris Brown getting a 53-yard and a 24-yard field goal. Oakland would take the lead in the third quarter with wide receiver Johnnie Lee Higgins catching a 29-yard touchdown pass from Russell, followed up by an 80-yard punt return for a touchdown.  The Texans tried to rally in the fourth quarter as Brown nailed a 40-yard field goal, yet the Raiders' defense would shut down any possible attempt.\n\nQuestion: Who threw the longest pass?",

The passage mentions JaMarcus Russell as the Raiders' quarterback. I need to check if any of his passes were particularly long. \n\n<rephrase> The Raiders' quarterback is JaMarcus Russell. The longest pass would be one thrown by him. The passage states he completed a 20-yard touchdown pass to Chaz Schilens in the first quarter. There's no mention of longer passes by Russell elsewhere in the story. \n\n<verify> The other Raiders players mentioned, like Johnnie Lee Higgins and Sebastian Janikowski, are not quarterbacks. The Texans' Vonta Leach and Kris Brown are running backs and kickers, so they didn't throw passes. \n\n<conclusion> Since Russell's longest completed pass is 20 yards, and there's no indication of longer passes by him or others, the answer must be JaMarcus Russell.\n</think>\n\\boxed{JaMarcus Russell}",

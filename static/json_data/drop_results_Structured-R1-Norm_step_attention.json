                "problem": "Passage:  Still searching for their first win, the Bengals flew to Texas Stadium for a Week 5 interconference duel with the Dallas Cowboys.  In the first quarter, Cincinnati trailed early as Cowboys kicker Nick Folk got a 30-yard field goal, along with RB Felix Jones getting a 33-yard TD run.  In the second quarter, Dallas increased its lead as QB Tony Romo completed a 4-yard TD pass to TE Jason Witten.  The Bengals would end the half with kicker Shayne Graham getting a 41-yard and a 31-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Cincinnati tried to rally as QB Carson Palmer completed an 18-yard TD pass to WR T. J. Houshmandzadeh.  In the fourth quarter, the Bengals got closer as Graham got a 40-yard field goal, yet the Cowboys answered with Romo completing a 57-yard TD pass to WR Terrell Owens.  Cincinnati tried to come back as Palmer completed a 10-yard TD pass to Houshmandzadeh (with a failed 2-point conversion), but Dallas pulled away with Romo completing a 15-yard TD pass to WR Patrick Crayton.\n\nQuestion: How many touchdowns did Crayton have?",

From the provided passage, I need to identify all the TD passes mentioned involving Terrell Crayton.\n\n<decompose> Let's break down the passage sentence by sentence. The Bengals vs. Cowboys game is described with various plays and scores.

Then, \"Rimuo completed a 57-yard TD pass to WR Terrell Owens.\" Here, Terrell Crayton is the receiver. Next, \"Palmer completed a 10-yard TD pass to Houshmandzadeh\" and \"Rokuo completed a 15-yard TD pass to WR Patrick Crayton.\" So, in the fourth quarter, Patrick Crayton, not Terrell, gets a touchdown.\n\n<verify> The question specifically asks for the number of touchdowns Crayton had. The passes mentioned are to Terrell and Patrick. The passage states that Crayton (likely Patrick) completed the pass for a TD. Are there any other mentions of Terrell's TD? The first quarter had a TD run by Felix Jones, but that's a run, not a TD. The other TDs were with_REUSE (Folk) and Romo. So, only one TD was thrown to Terrell Crayton.\n\n<conclusion> Therefore, the total number of touchdowns Crayton had is one.\n</think>\nThe question asks for the number of touchdowns Terrell Crayton had. Scanning the passage, the only mention of Terrell Crayton is in the fourth quarter when Carson Palmer threw a TD pass to him. There are no other TD passes to Terrell Crayton mentioned later. \n\n\\boxed{1}",

Hmm, so I need to relate a double sum involving j and k to the given series p and q.

Therefore, the double sum becomes \u2211_{n=2}^\u221e \u2211_{j=1}^{n-1} 1/n\u00b3. Wait, but j and k both start at 1, so n must be at least 2. Then the inner sum is just the number of terms where j + k = n, which is (n - 1) terms. So the double sum would be \u2211_{n=2}^\u221e (n - 1)/n\u00b3. But that seems like a single sum, which might be expressible in terms of p and q.\n</equivalent>\n\n<verify>\nLet me check that step again. Original sum is over j and k from 1 to \u221e of 1/(j + k)^3. If we fix n = j + k, then for each n, the number of pairs (j, k) such that j + k = n is (n - 1), because j can be 1 to n-1, and k is determined as n - j. Therefore, the double sum is indeed \u2211_{n=2}^\u221e (n - 1)/n\u00b3. So that's correct.\n</verify>\n\n<complete>\nNow, let's write that sum as \u2211_{n=2}^\u221e (n - 1)/n\u00b3 = \u2211_{n=2}^\u221e (1/n\u00b2 - 1/n\u00b3). Because (n - 1)/n\u00b3 = 1/n\u00b2 - 1/n\u00b3. Therefore, this sum is equal to \u2211_{n=2}^\u221e 1/n\u00b2 - \u2211_{n=2}^\u221e 1/n\u00b3. But the original p is \u2211_{k=1}^\u221e 1/k\u00b2, so \u2211_{n=2}^\u221e 1/n\u00b2 = p - 1. Similarly, q is \u2211_{k=1}^\u221e 1/k\u00b3, so \u2211_{n=2}^\u221e 1/n\u00b3 = q - 1. Therefore, the double sum is (p - 1) - (q - 1) = p - q. Wait, that seems too simple. Let me verify again.\n</think>\nThe given problem requires expressing the double sum \\(\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\\) in terms of \\(p = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2}\\) and \\(q = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3}\\).\n\nFirst, we change variables by setting \\(n = j + k\\).

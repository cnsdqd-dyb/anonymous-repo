        "problem": "Passage:  Hoping to rebound from their loss to the Patriots, the Raiders stayed at home for a Week 16 duel with the Houston Texans.  Oakland would get the early lead in the first quarter as quarterback JaMarcus Russell completed a 20-yard touchdown pass to rookie wide receiver Chaz Schilens.  The Texans would respond with fullback Vonta Leach getting a 1-yard touchdown run, yet the Raiders would answer with kicker Sebastian Janikowski getting a 33-yard and a 30-yard field goal.  Houston would tie the game in the second quarter with kicker Kris Brown getting a 53-yard and a 24-yard field goal. Oakland would take the lead in the third quarter with wide receiver Johnnie Lee Higgins catching a 29-yard touchdown pass from Russell, followed up by an 80-yard punt return for a touchdown.  The Texans tried to rally in the fourth quarter as Brown nailed a 40-yard field goal, yet the Raiders' defense would shut down any possible attempt.\n\nQuestion: Who threw the longest pass?",
        "ground_truth": "JaMarcus Russell",
        "prediction": "JaMarcus Russell",
        "correct": true,
        "full_response": "Okay, let's tackle this question: \"Who threw the longest pass?\" From the passage, I need to find out which Raiders player threw the longest pass during the game. Let's break down the information given step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the passage again to identify all the key plays and who was involved in passing. The Raiders (Oakland) played against the Texans (Houston). The Raiders scored a touchdown pass from JaMarcus Russell to Chaz Schilens, which was 20 yards. Then later in the third quarter, JaMarcus Russell threw a touchdown pass to Johnnie Lee Higgins, and the pass was 29 yards long. \n\nSo, the two QB passes mentioned are JaMarcus Russell to Chaz Schilens (20 yards) and Russell to Higgins (29 yards). Russell is the quarterback in both instances, so he threw those passes. \n\nThe other players mentioned in passes are Chaz Schilens, Higgins, and JaMarcus Russell. Since the question is about who threw the longest pass, we need to compare the lengths of these passes. Russell's 29-yard pass to Higgins is longer than his 20-yard pass to Schilens. \n\nThe other teams' players, like Vonta Leach, Kris Brown, and Sebastian Janikowski, were involved in scoring but weren't quarterbacks, so their roles weren't as relevant here. The kickers and the fullback were just receivers or kickers; they don't throw passes. The Punter mentioned an 80-yard punt return for a touchdown, but that was a return, not a thrown pass. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the two passes thrown by Russell are 20 and 29 yards. The longest is 29 yards. Therefore, JaMarcus Russell threw the longest pass in the game.\n</think>\nThe Raiders' quarterback Ja Marcus Russell threw two touchdown passes in the game.
